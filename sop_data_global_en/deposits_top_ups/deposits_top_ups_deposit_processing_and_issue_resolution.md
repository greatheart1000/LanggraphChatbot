# Deposits & Top-ups - Deposit Processing and Issue Resolution

## Steps

1. **Collect relevant deposit details from the player**
   - Request the player's username or account ID.
   - Ask for the specific deposit method used.
   - Obtain the deposit amount entered by the player.
   - Request a screenshot or proof of the deposit receipt, invoice, or transaction record, showing sender/recipient details and timestamp.
   - If applicable, ask for the transaction reference number or unique ID provided by the payment method.

2. **Verify deposit attempt and receipt provided by the player**
   - Check the provided proof of deposit against the transaction history or inbox of the indicated payment method (e.g., inbox in the wallet app).
   - Confirm the sender and recipient information, amount, and date/time to match the player's submission.
   - Note any discrepancies, such as incorrect amounts, transaction dates, or missing details.

3. **Check the deposit record in internal systems**
   - Access the back-office systems to verify if the deposit transaction has been received and recorded.
   - Determine the status of the deposit:
     - If reflected as credited, proceed to confirmation.
     - If not reflected, note the pending or uncredited status.

4. **Identify the cause of delay or issue**
   - Determine if the deposit is delayed due to:
     - System congestion or high transaction volume.
     - Payment gateway or network fluctuations.
     - Support or processing thresholds configured for the current site.
     - Maintenance periods affecting deposit processing.
   - Recognize specific supported deposit methods and their typical processing times, as per the current site's policies.
   - Take into account any site-specific minimum deposit amounts or thresholds that may influence processing.

5. **Decide on the resolution based on verification and system status**
   - If deposit is confirmed as successful in the payment system but not reflected in the account:
     - Advise the player to allow extra processing time.
     - Suggest refreshing their balance or account page periodically.
     - Confirm whether the deposit exceeds any minimum thresholds or falls within accepted parameters.
   - If the deposit appears to have failed, reversed, or was rejected:
     - Inform the player based on the transaction status.
     - Recommend reattempting after resolving issues with the payment provider if applicable.
   - If a deposit is delayed beyond the expected processing time:
     - Remind the player of potential system delays or maintenance windows.
     - Suggest trying alternative deposit methods supported by the platform (e.g., different e-wallets, bank transfer, or crypto options).

6. **Resolve or escalate as necessary**
   - For confirmed deposits not yet credited after reasonable wait:
     - Escalate the case to the finance or technical team with all collected documentation and transaction details.
   - For unresolved issues, advise the player to contact the payment provider or bank for further inquiry.
   - For duplicate or suspected erroneous deposits:
     - Verify the details of each deposit.
     - Coordinate with the finance team to process refunds or adjustments if confirmed as duplicate or incorrect.

7. **Communicate findings and actions to the player**
   - Provide clear, fact-based updates based on verification, including:
     - Confirmation of deposit receipt and processing status.
     - Estimated timeframe for credit if delayed.
     - Instructions for reattempting or using alternative methods if delays persist.
     - Tips to check deposit records and proof of payment.
     - If authorized, provide next steps for dispute or further investigation.

## Notes

- Deposit thresholds, processing times, and available deposit methods may vary depending on current site configurations; refer to the latest official rules or platform policies.
- During system maintenance or high load periods, deposit processing times may be longer, and balances may not reflect immediately.
- Always ensure the player’s deposit proof is clear, showing relevant sender, recipient, amount, and timestamp for verification.
- Rewards or promotional bonuses linked to deposits require confirmation of meeting specific conditions, including correct selection of bonus options and submission of required details before processing.
