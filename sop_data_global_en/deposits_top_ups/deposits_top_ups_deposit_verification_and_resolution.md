# Deposits & Top-ups - Deposit Verification and Resolution

## Steps

1. **Gather player's deposit information:**
   - Request the player to provide a screenshot or clear photograph of the deposit receipt from their wallet or payment provider (e.g., inbox receipt or transaction record).
   - Collect the player's account username or identifier used for deposits.
   - If available, ask for the deposit reference number, date, and time of the transaction to assist in verification.

2. **Verify the deposit details internally:**
   - Check the system or back-office records for the provided deposit reference, transaction ID, or screenshot against the player's account.
   - Ensure the deposit amount in the system matches the submitted receipt.
   - Confirm that the transaction date and time on the receipt align with the records.
   - If applicable, match the reference number, reference code, or transaction ID provided by the player with the system records.

3. **Identify potential delays or issues:**
   - Determine if the deposit has been processed or is pending due to system delays, bank processing time, or gateway maintenance.
   - Confirm whether the deposit receipt shows a successful transaction.
   - Recognize that delays can occur during high transaction volume or gateway downtime.

4. **Decide on the appropriate action based on verification:**
   - If the deposit is verified and matches system records:
     - Credit the deposit to the player's account.
     - Notify the player that the deposit has been successfully credited.
   - If the deposit is not found or does not match:
     - Inform the player that verification is ongoing.
     - Suggest re-checking the deposit receipt details.
     - Request additional proof if necessary.

5. **Follow-up and escalation:**
   - If the deposit remains unverified after standard checks:
     - Escalate the case to the relevant internal team for further investigation.
   - Advise the player to wait for a predetermined confirmation time (e.g., up to the maximum processing window specified by the site's policies).

6. **Communicate with the player:**
   - Provide timely updates regarding the status of their deposit verification.
   - If a refund or reversal is needed (e.g., failed deposit, duplicate transaction), initiate according to the site's refund policies and inform the player accordingly.
   - When applicable, instruct the player on alternative deposit methods if current ones are experiencing issues.

7. **Documentation and record keeping:**
   - Record all communication, deposit proof, and system checks related to the case.
   - Maintain logs for audit and resolution tracking purposes.
