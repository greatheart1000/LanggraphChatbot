# Deposits & Top-ups - Payment Method Issues and Alternatives

## Steps

1. **Identify the player's payment issue or inquiry**
   - Ask the player to specify the payment method used for their deposit or top-up.
   - Request relevant details such as transaction date, amount, and receipt or confirmation screenshot if available.

2. **Check the deposit status in the internal system/back office**
   - Verify if the deposit has been credited or reflected in the player's account.
   - Determine if there are any pending, delayed, or failed transactions based on system records.

3. **Determine if the payment method is currently operational**
   - Confirm whether the method used is experiencing maintenance, outages, or technical issues.
     - Note: The specific operational status may depend on current site configurations and official notices.

4. **Collect and review proof of payment if provided**
   - Ensure that the player has submitted a clear receipt or transaction confirmation.
   - Verify that the proof includes sender and recipient details, date, and time.
   - For methods like e-wallets, confirm the player has provided a screenshot or invoice from the wallet/app.

5. **Guide the player if payment method is delayed or not credited**
   - If the deposit is delayed due to technical issues with the payment method:
     - Advise the player to wait approximately the time specified by the current site's policies (often around 30-45 minutes).
     - Remind the player to check their transaction receipts and inbox or transaction history.
   
   - If the payment receipt is available but not credited:
     - Instruct the player to contact the payment provider directly for a refund or clarification.
     - Advise following the provider’s refund policy; refunds may take up to a specified period (e.g., 24-48 hours or as per provider policy).

6. **Recommend alternative payment methods**
   - If the original method is unavailable or unreliable:
     - Suggest using supported alternative payment channels (such as other e-wallets, bank transfer, or digital payment services).
     - For methods with known advantages (e.g., rebates or higher stability), advise accordingly, based on the site’s current policies.
   - Inform the player to wait some time (e.g., 30-45 minutes) after initiating an alternative method before checking if credited.

7. **Instruct on deposit proof submission for verification**
   - If required, instruct the player to upload or send proof of payment (screenshot, receipt, or invoice) for deposit verification.
   - Confirm that the proof includes all necessary details: sender, recipient, date/time.

8. **Advise on deposit limits and restrictions**
   - Remind the player that deposit limits (minimum and maximum amounts) vary by site configuration.
   - Ensure compliance with current thresholds as per the supported payment method and platform policies.

9. **Decide on resolution based on verification and deposit status**
   - If the deposit has been verified and credited:
     - Confirm the successful deposit to the player.
   - If delays or issues persist after waiting and alternative methods have been tried:
     - Escalate to support with all relevant transaction details.
     - Consider initiating a refund process if payment was made but not credited after an appropriate time.
     - Advise the player to contact their payment provider directly if the deposit was not credited and no resolution occurs.

## Notes

- The exact processing times and thresholds depend on the specific platform's policies and configurations.
- Always verify the status of the payment method during maintenance or outages before advising further actions.
- Ensure that the player understands that deposit funds are secured and will be credited once properly processed.
