# Deposits & Top-ups - Transaction Verification and Record Management

## Steps

1. **Guide the player to access their deposit or transaction records.**  
   - Instruct the player to navigate to the homepage and click on the 'Member' section.  
   - Ask them to select 'Deposit Record' or 'Withdrawal Record.'  
   - Advise them to take a screenshot of the record for reference and verification purposes.  
   - **Note:** If the player reports an issue, request the screenshot along with details of the transaction step performed.

2. **Request the detailed deposit or withdrawal receipt from the player.**  
   - Ensure the receipt clearly displays sender and recipient information (appropriate for the payment method used).  
   - Verify that the receipt and details are legible and complete to facilitate verification.

3. **Assist the player in providing supporting documentation if needed for verification.**  
   - Accept the deposit or withdrawal receipt, transaction screenshot, or relevant app entry as evidence.  
   - Confirm that the provided evidence is clear, readable, and contains all necessary transaction details.

4. **Verify transaction details in the internal system/back office.**  
   - Cross-check the transaction record, receipt, or evidence provided against system logs or incoming payment data.  
   - Confirm that the record of deposit or withdrawal matches the provided supporting documentation.  
   - **Note:** The transaction processing times are typically within a specified window; check whether the transaction has been processed or is pending according to the platform’s policy.

5. **Determine the status of the transaction.**  
   - If the transaction is confirmed as successful in both the system and the provided documentation, proceed to the next step.  
   - If unresolved issues or discrepancies are found, escalate for further investigation or explanation.

6. **Check for any additional requirements related to the player's current activity or promotion policies.**  
   - For deposits, verify whether the player has met any turnover or wagering requirements if applicable.  
   - Inform the player of the process to complete these requirements if necessary before withdrawal.

7. **Communicate the verification outcome to the player.**  
   - Confirm that the deposit or withdrawal has been successfully verified and processed.  
   - If delays occur, explain potential reasons such as system maintenance or high transaction volume.  
   - Advise the player to check their account after the expected processing time.

8. **Handle cases involving delays, disputes, or special conditions.**  
   - For transactions delayed beyond normal processing times, advise the player to wait and recheck after the period specified by the platform’s policy.  
   - If a dispute arises, escalate according to the platform’s dispute resolution procedures.

## Notes

- The exact thresholds for processing times and documentation requirements may vary across sites; always refer to the current site’s official policies.  
- Providing clear, legible, and complete evidence expedites verification and resolution.  
- Transaction details, such as specific payment channel information, are critical for reconciliation and may require additional confirmation if discrepancies are reported.

## Common questions

- What information do I need to verify a deposit or withdrawal?  
  - A detailed receipt including sender or recipient information, and a clear, readable record of the transaction.

- How long will my deposit or withdrawal take to process?  
  - Typically within the platform’s specified time frame, but delays of longer duration may occur during high volume or system maintenance.

- What should I do if I encounter issues with my deposit or withdrawal?  
  - Provide the transaction record and supporting evidence as requested, and wait for verification. Escalate if necessary according to platform procedures.
