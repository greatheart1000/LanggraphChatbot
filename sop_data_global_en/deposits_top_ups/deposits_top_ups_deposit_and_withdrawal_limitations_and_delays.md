# Deposits & Top-ups - Deposit and Withdrawal Limitations and Delays

## Steps

1. **Identify and Verify the Transaction Type**  
   - Determine whether the player is performing a deposit or a withdrawal request.  
   - Collect relevant details:
     - For deposits: payment method used, deposit amount, and transaction reference number if available.  
     - For withdrawals: requested amount, chosen withdrawal method, and transaction reference.

2. **Gather Supporting Documentation and Details**  
   - Instruct the player to keep and submit transaction receipts or screenshots that clearly show:
     - Payment method details (e.g., wallet app inbox, bank transfer confirmation).  
     - Transaction reference number.  
     - Timestamp of the transaction.  
   - For deposit verifications, request a screenshot of the payment confirmation or inbox message if applicable.

3. **Check Transaction Limits and Site Policies**  
   - Verify that the deposit or withdrawal amount falls within the configured minimum and maximum thresholds for the current site.  
   - Note: These thresholds may vary; always follow the latest official policies or help center guidance.

4. **Review System Status and Maintenance Notices**  
   - Check for any ongoing system maintenance, known delays, or technical issues affecting deposit or withdrawal channels.  
   - If a service is temporarily unavailable (e.g., due to maintenance), inform the player and suggest alternative methods supported by the platform.

5. **Assess Delay Factors and Possible Causes**  
   - Inform the player that delays may occur during system maintenance, high transaction volume, or network fluctuations.  
   - Advise checking transaction status after some time if the deposit or withdrawal is pending.

6. **Verify Transaction Reception or Processing**  
   - Confirm whether the deposit has been credited to the player's account:
     - Check the deposit record in the internal system or transaction history.  
     - Compare submitted receipt details with records; ensure amounts and references match.  
   - For withdrawals, verify the withdrawal record and check for confirmation or processing status.

7. **Handle Delayed or Failed Transactions**  
   - If a deposit or withdrawal has not been reflected within the typical processing window:
     - Request the player to submit the supporting receipt, timestamp, and transaction reference.  
     - Cross-check the information with internal records and payment provider logs.  
     - If delays are due to service issues, advise using alternative supported channels (e.g., different e-wallets, bank transfers).  
     - Inform the player that system issues may require additional processing time and that funds are secure.

8. **Decide on Appropriate Resolution or Further Action**  
   - If the transaction is verified but not yet credited, advise patience within the expected processing time.  
   - If the transaction is unverified or inconsistent:
     - Request additional proof or clarification from the player.  
     - Escalate to the back office if needed, providing all collected evidence.  
   - For issues related to limits or technical problems, advise the player to follow official guidance or wait for resolution.

9. **Update and Communicate with the Player**  
   - Inform the player of the current status, expected processing times, or any necessary next steps.  
   - If applicable, guide them on how to view their deposit or withdrawal history via their account records.

10. **Advise on Preventative Measures for Future Transactions**  
    - Encourage keeping transaction references and screenshots for verification.  
    - Remind players to ensure their transaction details match the official records to facilitate smooth processing.

## Notes

- Transaction thresholds and policies (minimum/maximum amounts, supported channels, processing times) may vary by site; always refer to the latest official details.
- During system maintenance or known delays, suggest alternative deposit or withdrawal methods supported by the platform.
- GCash or similar e-wallet services might experience temporary outages; alternative methods such as bank transfers or other e-wallets should be used when available.
- The typical processing window for deposits or withdrawals may differ depending on the payment method and system status; always communicate realistic expectations based on current conditions.
