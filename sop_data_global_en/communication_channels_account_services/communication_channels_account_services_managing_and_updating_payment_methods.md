# Communication Channels & Account Services - Managing and Updating Payment Methods

## Steps

1. **Identify the payment method type**  
   - Determine whether the player’s concern involves e-wallets, bank accounts, or withdrawal/payment methods.  
   - For e-wallets, specify the e-wallet brand (if applicable), e.g., GCash, Maya, PayMaya, etc.  

2. **Gather player identification and transaction details**  
   - Collect the player's username or Player ID.  
   - Obtain relevant transaction information, such as recent transaction references or related activity details.  
   - Request a clear, valid ID and a selfie with the ID if identity verification or unbinding is required.  
   - Ask the player to provide a detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce, if possible.  

3. **Verify the current payment method status**  
   - Check the player’s account in the internal system or back-office to review linked payment methods.  
   - Confirm the number of linked e-wallet or bank accounts.  
   - Note that some e-wallets cannot be removed or unbound if only one is linked; additional accounts may need to be added before removal.  

4. **Assess the operation feasibility based on current system rules**  
   - Verify whether the requested action (binding, unbinding, adding, or changing) complies with the platform’s policies, including limits on the number of linked accounts, specific restrictions on certain e-wallet brands, or region-specific rules.  
   - If the site allows adding multiple e-wallet accounts, ensure the new account details are different from existing linked accounts.  
   - Remember that only one e-wallet can be unbound per day; plan accordingly.  
   - Clarify that e-wallets that cannot be removed include those that are currently the only linked method or are otherwise restricted by policy.  

5. **Proceed with unbinding, if requested**  
   - To unbind an e-wallet or bank account:  
     - Instruct the player to submit a request with their full name, username, the specific account number to be removed, and the reason for unbinding.  
     - Collect supporting documents: a clear picture of valid ID and a selfie holding the ID.  
     - Confirm the ID and selfie are clear and readable.  
   - Submit the request for processing, noting that unbinding may require validation and can take some time depending on the procedure.  

6. **Proceed with binding or adding a new payment method**  
   - To bind or add an e-wallet or bank account:  
     - Guide the player to access the "My Cards" or equivalent section in the account.  
     - Click the add button (+ sign) or equivalent.  
     - Select "E-wallet" or "Bank Account" as the type.  
     - Input the account name (matching their ID), the account number (e.g., 11-digit for e-wallets), and any other required details.  
     - Create or input a transaction password if prompted.  
     - Submit the details for binding.  

7. **Validate completion of the operation**  
   - Confirm that the new payment method has been successfully added or unbound in the system.  
   - Verify that the player receives acknowledgment or confirmation of the change.  
   - Advise the player to check their account or payment method list to ensure the updates are reflected.  

8. **Address special cases and restrictions**  
   - If the player attempts to unbind their only linked wallet, inform them that unbinding is not permitted until another payment method is added.  
   - Remind that reusing the same e-wallet account number across multiple game accounts is forbidden and may result in account penalties.  
   - For payment methods that cannot be removed due to local policies or system restrictions, advise on alternative options or request escalation through support channels.  

## Notes

- The exact number of linked e-wallet accounts allowed, as well as unbinding limits, depend on the current site configuration and official policies.  
- All document and selfie uploads must be clear and legible.  
- Unbinding or binding processes are subject to verification and validation procedures, which may vary by region or platform policy.  

## Common questions

- It is not possible to remove or unbind a linked e-wallet if it is the only one associated with the account. Additional accounts must be added first.  
- Only one e-wallet or bank account can generally be unbound per request, and only one unbinding action is permitted per day.  
- If issues arise during binding or unbinding, contact support with your account details and proof of identity for assistance.  
- Policy for managing linked payment methods may vary; always follow the latest official instructions provided by the support or help center of the current platform.
