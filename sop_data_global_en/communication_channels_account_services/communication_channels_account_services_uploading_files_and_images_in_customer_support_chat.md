# Communication Channels & Account Services - Uploading Files and Images in Customer Support Chat

## Steps

1. **Initiate Contact and Verify Support Channel**
   - Ensure that the customer has accessed the support chat via the official platform.
   - Confirm that the customer is requesting assistance related to account or communication services.

2. **Clarify the Request and Determine Upload Needs**
   - Ask the customer if they need to upload a photo, screenshot, file, or documentation.
   - Confirm the specific purpose of the upload (e.g., account verification, issue resolution).

3. **Instruct the Customer on How to Upload Files or Images**
   - Advise the customer to locate and click the **File** attachment button within the chat interface.
   - Instruct the customer to select the appropriate image, screenshot, or file from their device's folder or gallery.
   - Remind the customer to ensure the file size complies with the maximum allowed threshold (typically up to **20MB**, but this may vary by site; refer to the current site's configuration).

4. **Verify File Size and Compatibility**
   - Confirm that the customer has selected a supported file type (images or videos) and that the size does not exceed the platform's limit.
   - If the upload fails, instruct the customer to check device permissions, such as allowing full access to photos and videos in device settings.

5. **Perform Internal Checks During Upload**
   - When the customer has uploaded a file, verify that the file has been received correctly within the support system.
   - Check for any upload errors or incomplete transfers.

6. **Document the Upload and Proceed with Support**
   - Confirm receipt of the file with the customer.
   - Use or review the uploaded content as needed to address the customer’s inquiry.
   - If the uploaded file is incomplete or problematic, ask the customer to re-upload following the previous steps.

7. **Provide Resolution or Guidance**
   - Based on the uploaded content, give the appropriate explanation, solution, or next steps.
   - If further uploads are needed, instruct the customer to repeat the upload process.

8. **Close the Support Session**
   - Confirm that the customer’s issue has been addressed or correctly escalated.
   - Ensure all files are appropriately stored or referenced if needed for record-keeping, in accordance with the platform’s policies.
