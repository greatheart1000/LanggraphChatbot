# Communication Channels & Account Services - Managing Deposit and Withdrawal Records and Methods

## Steps

1. **Identify the player's request or issue related to deposit or withdrawal records or account linkage.**  
   - Determine whether the player needs to view records, request unbinding/unlinking, or seek assistance with deposit/withdrawal methods.  
   - Collect relevant details such as full name, username, and specific account details (e.g., account number, e-wallet ID).

2. **Request and verify necessary identification or supporting documents if account modification is involved.**  
   - For unbinding or removing linked accounts or methods, ask the player to provide:  
     - A clear photo of a valid ID.  
     - A selfie holding the ID.  
     - Specific account details (e.g., account number) and reason for change.  
   - Ensure all images are clear and legible.

3. **Access internal systems or back-office tools to locate the requested records or account details.**  
   - For deposit or withdrawal records:  
     - Navigate to the player's profile or member section.  
     - Locate and open 'Deposit Record' or 'Withdrawal Record' as applicable.  
     - Capture a screenshot of the record for documentation.  
   - For unbinding or updating account methods:  
     - Verify the provided details against the system records.  
     - Check the account/withdrawal method status.

4. **Perform necessary checks based on site-specific policies or thresholds.**  
   - Confirm whether the requested record exists and is within the accessible timeframe.  
   - Verify the authenticity of documents provided for account unbinding or modification requests.  
   - Follow the current site's policy regarding unbinding limits, waiting periods, or maximum number of linked methods.

5. **Determine the appropriate response or resolution based on the verification process.**  
   - If records are found and requests are valid:  
     - Provide the screenshot or relevant information to the player as proof or record.  
   - If unbinding or changes are authorized and verified:  
     - Process the request by unbinding or updating the account details in the system.  
     - Inform the player about any waiting period or confirmation steps if applicable.  
   - If documentation is insufficient or request invalid:  
     - Explain the reason clearly and request additional information or documentation if necessary.

6. **Communicate with the player via official channels.**  
   - Use the designated support channels (e.g., live chat, email) supported by the platform.  
   - Remind the player to avoid sharing sensitive information via insecure channels or unverified contact points.  
   - If using emails, advise sending images through the appropriate email addresses with clear subject references.

7. **Securely record and document the interaction and verification process.**  
   - Save screenshots, communication logs, and verification evidence for audit purposes.  
   - Ensure compliance with data protection policies by handling all personal and sensitive information securely.

8. **Close the support interaction with clear instructions or confirmation.**  
   - Confirm the completion of the record retrieval or account modification if applicable.  
   - Inform the player of any expected follow-up actions or delays based on internal procedures.  
   - Advise on any additional steps if needed (e.g., waiting periods).
