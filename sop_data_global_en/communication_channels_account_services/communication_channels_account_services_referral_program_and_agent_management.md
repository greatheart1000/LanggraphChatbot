# Communication Channels & Account Services - Referral Program and Agent Management

## Steps

1. **Guide the user to access the referral or agent registration process.**  
   - Instruct the user to locate and click the relevant link or section designated for agents or referral programs on the platform's homepage or main menu.  
   - Advise copying the generated referral link or referral code offered in this section.

2. **Ask the user to share their referral link or code via supported social media or messaging platforms.**  
   - Specify social media platforms or messaging channels supported by the platform, as applicable within the current site's configuration.  
   - Remind the user to distribute their referral link widely to maximize reach.

3. **Collect necessary information from the user to identify the referral activity.**  
   - Request the user to confirm their referral link or code, which will be used to track successful referrals.  
   - Advise the user to keep their referral link or code secure and avoid sharing in ways that could be misused.

4. **Instruct the user on how to generate a valid referral or invite.**  
   - Explain that a referral becomes valid once the invited player deposits a minimum amount, and, depending on site policy, may need to perform certain actions like placing bets.  
   - Remind the user that violations such as sharing with fake accounts, same IP, same phone number, or same bank card may disqualify the referral.

5. **Verify referral activity and status in the internal system or back-office records.**  
   - Check whether the referred player has made a qualifying deposit according to the current site's minimum requirement.  
   - Confirm that the players’ deposits and bets are aligned with site-specific policies for referral validation.  
   - Review whether the referral activity complies with rules to prevent disqualification due to fraud signals like multiple accounts or shared information.

6. **Determine the eligibility for earning referral commissions or bonuses.**  
   - Confirm that the referral activity meets the site-specific criteria (e.g., deposit amount, activity, unique identifiers).  
   - Identify the type and amount of commission or bonus the user is entitled to, based on the current configuration.  
   - Note that commission payments are typically credited automatically after the activity, but may require manual claiming via the platform's rewards or bonus center.

7. **Guide the user on how to claim or verify earned commissions or bonuses.**  
   - Advise navigating to the dedicated section for income, rewards, or the bonus center.  
   - Instruct to check the status of their commissions or bonuses, and perform a claim if manual submission is required.  
   - Remind that automatic crediting is common, but further steps may be needed depending on the site.

8. **Address special cases or disqualifications.**  
   - Inform the user that referrals may be disqualified if detected engaging in activity considered fraudulent or against the rules, such as using identical bank details, phone numbers, IP addresses, or creating multiple accounts.  
   - Explain that rewards may be suspended or confiscated if rules are violated.

9. **Provide instructions for updating or unbinding linked personal or payment information.**  
   - Instruct users to submit a formal request with all required details, including identification and reason for change.  
   - Clarify that the platform will verify the request and implement changes within a designated processing time, typically within a few hours or days.

10. **Assist the user with login/password management if relevant.**  
    - For password resets, guide through the process of inputting username, current password (or reset credentials), and setting a new password.  
    - Confirm successful updates and advise re-login if needed.

## Notes

- The specific thresholds for deposit amounts, commission percentages, and tier levels depend on the current site's configuration and official policies; always refer to the latest official rules or help center for precise details.  
- Fraud prevention measures include disqualification if multiple accounts, same IP, or shared bank or contact details are detected. These checks are integral to referral validation.  
- Commissions and bonuses are typically credited automatically after qualifying activity, but users may need to manually claim rewards via designated sections.

## Common questions

- How do I verify my referral activity and earnings?  
  Check the relevant records or income sections in your account dashboard; support may request screenshots of invitation records for verification.

- How do I update or unbind my linked payment or contact details?  
  Submit a request with necessary identification and specified details; the platform will process and confirm changes per current policies.

- What actions disqualify a referral?  
  Using the same bank card, phone number, IP address, or creating multiple accounts for fraudulent activity can lead to disqualification and confiscation of rewards.
