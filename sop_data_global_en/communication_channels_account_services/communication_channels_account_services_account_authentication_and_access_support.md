# Communication Channels & Account Services - Account Authentication and Access Support

## Steps

1. **Identify the nature of the issue**  
   - Determine if the player reports trouble with login, account access, OTP receipt, account binding/unbinding, or other account services.

2. **Gather relevant information from the player**  
   - Confirm the registered account details, such as username, email address, or registered phone number.  
   - Ask about the specific problem experienced (e.g., not receiving OTP, login failure, account unbinding request).  
   - Request details of the device and verification method used (e.g., mobile, web browser).

3. **Verify account identity and status**  
   - Check whether the account is active and not locked or suspended, based on internal system records.  
   - Confirm the entered account details match the records (correct username, email, or phone number).

4. **Assess OTP or verification code issues**  
   - Instruct the player to ensure their device has a strong signal and can receive SMS or app notifications.  
   - Advise waiting for an appropriate time window as delivery may be delayed during peak network traffic or due to network restrictions.  
   - Verify if the player is using the supported network/operator for OTP receipt as per current configuration.  
   - Recommend changing the registered phone number or verification method if issues persist.

5. **Assist with OTP resending procedures**  
   - Instruct the player to request a new OTP after the waiting period.  
   - Confirm the correct input of the phone number or email address during request.  
   - If multiple attempts fail, advise re-logging into the account and requesting verification again.

6. **Guide on system checks and operations**  
   - Advise the player to restart their device or app if they encounter receiving or input errors.  
   - Suggest checking spam/junk folders for email-based verification messages if applicable.  
   - Verify that they are using the latest app version or that the web browser is updated and supported.

7. **Handle specific service requests (binding/unbinding accounts)**  
   - For binding digital wallets or bank accounts:  
     - Guide the player to access the relevant section (e.g., "My Cards" or "Account Settings").  
     - Instruct them to input correct account details and submit.  
   - For unbinding accounts or accounts with support requirements:  
     - Collect the necessary verification documents (clear ID, selfie with ID, reason for unbinding).  
     - Confirm that the player provides all required details for processing, following the official procedures.

8. **Perform internal checks and follow-up actions**  
   - Confirm if the account is eligible for manual verification or reset based on internal policies and current configurations.  
   - Advise the player on any additional steps needed, such as submitting identification or verifying via support channels.

9. **Resolve or escalate as appropriate**  
   - If the issue is due to technical restrictions or network delays, inform the player and suggest retrying after some time.  
   - For persistent issues, escalate to technical or support teams for manual intervention or further verification.  
   - Clearly communicate that thresholds, available channels, or procedures may differ based on site-specific configurations and policies.

## Notes

- OTP delivery can be affected by network restrictions, operator outages, or country-specific restrictions; use supported networks and verify contact details.  
- Changing account linked channels requires providing valid ID, reason, and supporting documents as per site-specific rules.  
- Password resets and account recovery often involve support verification steps; ensure accurate details are provided during requests.  
- In case of login failures or access errors, restart devices, switch networks, disable VPNs, or try alternative access URLs if available.  

## Common questions

- When players do not receive OTP codes, instruct them to verify signal strength, wait the recommended period, and consider switching network providers if possible.  
- For account binding or unbinding, ensure players provide all required documentation and follow official submission procedures.  
- If a player forgets their username, advise them to log in with their registered phone number or email and contact support if needed.  
- For persistent login issues, verify login credentials, app version, and network connection, then escalate if unresolved.
