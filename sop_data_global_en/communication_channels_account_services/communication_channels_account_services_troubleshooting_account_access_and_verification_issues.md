# Communication Channels & Account Services - Troubleshooting Account Access and Verification Issues

## Steps

1. **Gather player information**
   - Collect essential details such as the player's registered contact methods (mobile number, email) and account identifiers.
   - Confirm that the contact information provided matches the records in your system.
   - If applicable, request the player to specify the exact issue they are encountering with account access or verification.

2. **Verify the player's ability to receive messages**
   - Instruct the player to check their mobile signal strength and ensure the device can receive SMS messages.
   - Ask if the player is using supported network providers, noting that issues may occur with certain providers or SIM cards.
   - Confirm whether the player can receive messages on other devices or numbers if available.

3. **Instruct on requesting verification codes or OTPs**
   - Advise the player to request the code again, ensuring they wait the appropriate amount of time between requests (e.g., 5–30 minutes, depending on site policy).
   - Remind the player not to request codes excessively; note that there is a limit to the number of requests within a set time frame (e.g., up to five times per day). 
   - If the player has reached the request limit, instruct them to wait until the next eligible period, as per current site policy.

4. **Perform troubleshooting steps if OTPs or verification codes are not received**
   - Confirm the player has a strong signal and is using a supported network provider (e.g., supported carriers as per platform policy).
   - Suggest restarting the device to resolve temporary network or message receipt issues.
   - Recommend clearing cookies and cache if using an app or web portal.
   - Have the player attempt to request the code again after a short wait if necessary.
   - Encourage trying an alternative phone number or contact method if available and supported.
   - For persistent issues, advise the player to temporarily switch to a different SIM card/provider known to reliably receive verification messages (e.g., using supported networks); note that network-specific issues may affect OTP delivery.

5. **Assess and advise on account verification methods**
   - If the player cannot receive SMS or OTPs, suggest verifying via alternative methods if previously set up (e.g., email verification).
   - If other verification methods are not available, direct the player to contact support for manual assistance or alternative verification options.

6. **Address account-specific verification issues**
   - If the player reports problems with account access, verify their identity by requesting relevant identification details or screenshots of their profile, if applicable.
   - Confirm that the account details provided match the records and that the account is active.
   - If password reset is needed, guide the player through the reset process:
     - Use the "Forgot Password" feature.
     - Choose a registered verification method.
     - Request a reset code and follow instructions to set a new password.
   - If the player cannot use the registered contact methods (e.g., lost access to email or phone), advise them to contact support for manual verification and recovery procedures.

7. **Confirm the resolution or escalate as needed**
   - Ensure the player successfully logs in or completes the necessary verification.
   - If issues persist after following all troubleshooting steps, escalate the case to higher-level support or security review, providing all collected information and actions taken.

## Notes

- Exact thresholds for OTP request limits and supported network providers may vary according to site-specific policies; always refer to the current site's configuration.
- Changing the registered contact details may be necessary if persistent issues arise with message receipt.
- Support should be prepared to assist with manual verification when automated processes fail, especially if the player cannot receive verification codes via SMS.

## Common questions

- What should I do if I don't receive my OTP code?
  - Ensure your device has a strong signal and can receive SMS messages.
  - Attempt to request the code again after some minutes.
  - Restart your device and try again.
  - Use a supported network provider, or try with an alternative number if available.
  - If the issue persists, contact support for assistance.

- Is there a limit to how many OTP requests I can make?
  - Yes, generally limited to a set number within a specific time period; exceeding this limit requires waiting until the next allowed period, as per current site policy.

- Can I verify my account via alternative methods?
  - Yes, if these are already set up, such as email verification; otherwise, contact support to explore manual recovery options.

- What should I do if I cannot verify my identity online?
