# Game & Betting Rules - Detection and Management of Abnormal Betting Activity

## Steps

1. **Monitor betting activity for abnormal patterns**
   - Continuously review betting behaviors, especially on live games, for signs of irregular or suspicious activity.
   - Detect repeated, unusually high, or atypical betting patterns, as well as suspicious IP activity.
   - Be aware that the system automatically flags abnormal betting activity based on predefined criteria (which vary per site according to configuration).

2. **Identify flagged accounts**
   - When a betting activity triggers the system's detection, verify if the account has been flagged for abnormal or irregular betting.
   - Check for indications such as unusual betting patterns, suspicious IP addresses, or abnormal profits from irregular activity.

3. **Inform the player of detection and explain potential consequences**
   - Notify the player that their betting activity has been flagged for abnormal patterns, in accordance with the site's internal policies.
   - Clarify that:
     - Profits gained from abnormal betting may be subject to deduction.
     - Continued abnormal activity could lead to further restrictions or account suspension.
     - The review process may involve an internal audit of betting history.

4. **Assess the player's betting activity and enforce restrictions if necessary**
   - Require the player to continue wagering in allowed game types (e.g., slot games) to complete any required turnover, if applicable.
   - Advise the player that withdrawals may be delayed or paused until the review is completed and the activity is verified as compliant with the rules.
   - Remind the player to bet normally and avoid further irregular activity to prevent penalties.

5. **Review betting history and system flags**
   - Conduct an internal review of the account’s betting history, focusing on:
     - Patterns that align with flagged activity.
     - Any evidence of malicious or illegal software use.
   - Confirm if the betting activity aligns with the criteria for abnormal or irregular activity as per the current site's configuration.

6. **Apply appropriate sanctions or restrictions**
   - If abnormal betting activity is confirmed:
     - Deduct any profits associated with such activity, as per the system's anti-fraud policies.
     - Temporarily freeze the account if required, pending further review.
     - Communicate the outcome clearly to the player, including any deductions or restrictions applied.
     - For malicious or illegal activity, consider account suspension or other corrective actions per policy.

7. **Process withdrawals after activity normalization**
   - Allow withdrawal only after:
     - The player has completed the required betting activity or turnover on permitted game types.
     - The internal review confirms that betting activity is in compliance.
   - Ensure that any flagged profits are appropriately deducted prior to releasing funds.

8. **Handle system-initiated delays or closures of game types**
   - Recognize that certain game types, especially live games or lottery games, may be temporarily delayed, closed for maintenance, or subject to draw delays.
   - Communicate clearly to players if delays occur due to official draws or system updates, and advise on subsequent steps.

9. **Maintain records of detected activity and actions taken**
   - Log all detection instances, reviews, and sanctions applied.
   - Document the rationale for restrictions, deductions, or account suspensions for auditing and transparency.

## Notes

- The specific thresholds and criteria for detection, restrictions, or deductions depend on each site's current policies and configuration; always refer to the latest official rules.
- The detection system may automatically deduct profits from irregular betting activities, including malicious arbitrage or illegal betting.
- Continued or extreme irregular betting activity may result in further penalties, including permanent account suspension, in accordance with internal policies.
