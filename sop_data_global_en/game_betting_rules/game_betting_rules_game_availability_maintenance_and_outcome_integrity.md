# Game & Betting Rules - Game Availability, Maintenance, and Outcome Integrity

## Steps

1. **Identify the player's reported issue or inquiry related to game or bet outcome**
   - Collect relevant details, such as:
     - The specific game or provider involved
     - Whether the issue involves game availability, outcome, balance, or result discrepancies
     - Any observed issues during game play or after maintenance

2. **Verify the status of the game or provider at the time of the reported incident**
   - Check if the game or provider is currently under scheduled or unscheduled maintenance
   - Confirm if there are ongoing system or platform-wide maintenance activities
   - Note that game results or balances may be temporarily unavailable during maintenance

3. **Determine whether the issue involves game outcome, balance discrepancies, or game unavailability**
   - For balance issues during maintenance:
     - Inform the player that any temporary freeze or disappearance of funds during maintenance will be reversed automatically once the system or game service resumes
   - For game outcome or result issues:
     - Confirm that all outcomes are generated randomly by the system (i.e., RNG-based)
     - Explain that outcomes cannot be manually programmed or manipulated
     - Emphasize that all winnings and losses are automatically recorded and credited
   - For game unavailability:
     - Advise the player that the game is currently under maintenance or experiencing technical issues
     - Inform that gameplay and results are paused until the service is restored

4. **Advise the player to wait for automatic resolution if the issue is related to maintenance**
   - Explain that all funds are secured and will be automatically restored once maintenance concludes
   - Recommend the player to:
     - Log in again after the estimated or confirmed end of maintenance
     - Avoid attempting to replay or manipulate the system during this period

5. **For issues related to game fairness or outcome predictability**
   - Clarify that all games are based on certified RNG systems
   - Confirm that outcomes are random and cannot be pre-determined or influenced by staff or players
   - Reinforce that winnings are credited automatically upon a successful result, with no manual intervention possible

6. **For concerns about game manipulation or rigging**
   - Explain that all games are computer-generated and cannot be manually manipulated or rigged
   - Affirm that outcomes are determined exclusively by the system’s RNG algorithm
   - Confirm that all winnings and losses are recorded automatically by the system

7. **If the player reports or inquiries about missing balance after game or platform maintenance**
   - Verify whether the balance was temporarily frozen during maintenance
   - Reassure that the balance will be automatically restored to the main wallet/account once maintenance ends
   - Advise the player to check their balance after the estimated system recovery time or after logging in again

8. **In cases of prolonged or unresolved discrepancies**
   - Collect necessary system logs or records supporting automatic recordings of winnings or balance restorations
   - Escalate to technical or back-office support for further investigation if required

9. **Provide the player with guidance on how to view game results and balances**
   - Instruct to log out and log back into the platform if needed
   - Remind that cache clearing or app refresh may help in viewing the most recent balance or results but does not influence game outcomes

10. **Document the interaction and resolution status according to internal procedures**
    - Record the incident details, actions taken, and outcomes in the case management system
    - Communicate clear instructions or clarifications to the player based on the current site’s policies and configurations

## Notes
- The exact timing and thresholds for automatic balance restorations during maintenance depend on each platform’s configuration; always refer to the current site’s official rules.
- During system or provider maintenance, all active game results are temporarily paused, and funds are secured in accordance with the platform’s security policies.

## Common questions
- How do I know when a game or provider is under maintenance?  
  Check the platform’s status notifications or system messages.
- What should I do if my balance disappears during maintenance?  
  Wait for automatic restoration after maintenance ends; do not attempt manual transactions.
- Are game outcomes guaranteed or can they be manipulated?  
  Outcomes are random, generated by RNG, and cannot be manually manipulated or guaranteed.
- How are winnings recorded and credited?  
  Automatically by the system once results are generated and verified.
- What happens during a game or system maintenance?  
  The game or balance may be temporarily frozen; funds are secured and will be restored automatically when maintenance completes.
