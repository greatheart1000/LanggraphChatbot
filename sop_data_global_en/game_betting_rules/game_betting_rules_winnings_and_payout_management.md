# Game & Betting Rules - Winnings and Payout Management

## Steps

1. **Gather Player Information Regarding Winnings and Losses**  
   - Ask the player if they have experienced recent losses on games such as slots, fish, or poker.  
   - Confirm if the player has had any winnings or bonuses credited from game outcomes.  
   - Collect details about any ongoing bonuses or rewards related to losses or gameplay.  
   - *Note:* Winnings and losses are automatically tracked by the system based on game outcomes.

2. **Verify Winnings and Losses in the System**  
   - Check the player’s game history and account records within the back office or relevant system modules to confirm the recorded winnings and losses.  
   - Ensure that the recordings are consistent with the game results, as all outcomes are generated and recorded automatically.  
   - Confirm that winnings are credited automatically to the player’s account when the system processes the payout.

3. **Assess the Nature of the Winnings or Losses**  
   - Determine if the player’s recent activity qualifies under the site policy, such as qualifying losses (e.g., losing over a defined threshold) or winnings.  
   - For loss-based rewards, verify if the player’s losses meet the minimum required for bonus eligibility, according to the current site configuration.  
   - For winnings, confirm that the credited amount aligns with system records and game outcomes.

4. **Explain the Automated and Chance-Based Nature of Outcomes**  
   - Inform the player that all game results are generated automatically by the system and depend solely on chance; outcomes are random and cannot be manually influenced or guaranteed.  
   - Clarify that all winnings and losses are not manually manipulated but are recorded automatically by the system.

5. **Review Policies on Winnings and Payouts**  
   - Make the player aware that winnings are automatically credited to their balance upon game completion as per system processing.  
   - Clarify that there are no manual adjustments or guarantees for winning amounts.  
   - State that payout timing depends on the system’s processing and specific site configurations; there is no guaranteed payout timeframe.

6. **Confirm Conditions for Winnings and Payout Eligibility**  
   - Ensure that the player has fulfilled all game-based or bonus-specific conditions, such as completing required turnovers or playing within designated game types (e.g., slot or fish games).  
   - Refer players to the current site's policies or official rules for exact thresholds and permitted payment channels, as these may vary by site.

7. **Address Special Cases and Potential Issues**  
   - Notify the player if recent losses qualify for rescue bonuses or rewards, and confirm the bonus has been credited to the Rewards Center, if applicable.  
   - Warn that outcomes depend solely on system-generated results; no effect can be exerted over the randomness or timing of payouts.  
   - Remind players to follow official policies for maximum payout limits or specific reward conditions, which are subject to the current site's configuration.

## Notes
- Winnings and losses are automatically tracked and credited by the system; manual intervention is not applicable.  
- All game outcomes are purely chance-based and generated automatically; no guaranteed wins exist.  
- Policies for specific thresholds, bonus criteria, and payout timeframes may vary by site and are governed by current official rules.
