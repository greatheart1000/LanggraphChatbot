# Game & Betting Rules - Turnover and Withdrawal Conditions

## Steps

1. **Collect player information regarding current balance and active bonuses**  
   - Verify if the player has any bonuses or promotional offers active that may be subject to specific turnover requirements.  
   - Record the total cash balance and any bonus amounts.

2. **Inform the player about the requirement to meet a turnover (playthrough) before withdrawal**  
   - Explain that the system requires certain wagering or betting activity to be completed before a withdrawal can be processed.  
   - Clarify that the specific threshold or multiple depends on the current site’s configuration and policy.

3. **Identify the games eligible for fulfilling the turnover requirement**  
   - Confirm that the player is playing on designated games that count towards the turnover.  
   - Note that the designated games typically include certain categories such as slots and fish games, but specific eligible games depend on the platform’s current settings.

4. **Monitor the player’s gameplay activity**  
   - Track the total amount played on eligible games from the time the player requests a withdrawal or as per system requirements.  
   - Ensure that the player has completed at least one full turn of play, meaning sufficient gameplay to meet the minimum activity requirements for withdrawal eligibility.

5. **Calculate the total turnover amount required**  
   - Determine the required turnover based on the amount initially deposited, bonus amounts, or specified policy for the current promotion or account type.  
   - Use the formula: **Turnover = (Cash In + Bonus) × site-specific turnover requirement**, with thresholds dependent on current configuration.

6. **Verify that the player has met the turnover requirement**  
   - Check the system records to confirm that the total wagers on designated games have reached or exceeded the required total.  
   - If the required turnover has not been met, advise the player to continue playing on eligible games until the threshold is fulfilled.

7. **Review gameplay activity for irregularities**  
   - The system may detect irregular betting patterns; profits from such activity may be subject to deduction as per platform policies.  
   - Ensure that there are no violations that could affect the eligibility to withdraw.

8. **Process player’s withdrawal request**  
   - Once the turnover requirement has been met, review the account activity to confirm compliance with general withdrawal policies.  
   - Approve the withdrawal request if all conditions are satisfied, noting that the exact approval process may vary per site.

9. **Communicate the outcome to the player**  
   - Inform the player whether the withdrawal has been approved or if additional gameplay is needed to meet the turnover requirement.  
   - If not approved, advise on the remaining gameplay needed to qualify.
