# Game & Betting Rules - Detection and Handling of Irregular Betting Activities

## Steps

1. **Collect relevant account information from the player**
   - Ask the player to log into their account to review their betting history, including accumulated deposits and bets.
   - If applicable, assist the player in navigating to their betting history or activity summary.
   - In cases of dispute or investigation, record the player's account details and specific activities involved.

2. **Review and monitor betting activity for irregularities**
   - Use the internal system to detect irregular betting patterns or abnormal activity linked to the account.
   - Check for signs of malicious arbitrage, suspicious betting behavior, or other activity flagged by the system.
   - Be aware that the system automatically monitors for irregular betting and may identify activities that deviate from normal betting behavior.

3. **Assess game results and outcome recordings**
   - Confirm that game results are generated by the system using random number generation algorithms.
   - Verify that game outcomes are automatically recorded and cannot be manually manipulated.
   - Review the betting history to ensure transactions are consistent with system records.

4. **Determine if irregular betting activity is detected**
   - If the system flags irregular activity, identify whether profits from those activities are involved.
   - Recognize that, based on platform policy, profits gained from irregular or suspicious betting activities may be subject to deduction.

5. **Decide on the appropriate resolution based on detected activity**
   - If irregular activity is confirmed, inform the player that profits earned from such activity may be deducted in accordance with anti-fraud and fair-play policies.
   - Clarify that winnings and losses are automatically recorded and cannot be manually adjusted.
   - If a technical error or system anomaly is suspected, note that balances may temporarily freeze but will be restored once the issue is resolved.

6. **Check for compliance with betting and withdrawal requirements**
   - Verify whether the player has fulfilled the necessary turnover or betting requirements as per the current site configuration.
   - Advise the player to complete the relevant betting or wagering activities using permitted game types (e.g., slot or other designated games) before initiating withdrawals.
   - Inform the player that abnormal betting activity may prevent withdrawal until requirements are met and irregular activity is addressed.

7. **Handle suspected irregular or suspicious activity**
   - If irregular or malicious activity is suspected, inform the player that their account may be subject to suspension or further review.
   - Advise the player to continue playing designated games (e.g., slot games) instead of live or high-risk games during review, if applicable.
   - Notify the player of any actions taken, including potential deduction of illicit profits.

8. **Document and communicate findings and actions**
   - Record all relevant details about the detected activity, steps taken, and communications with the player.
   - Convey clearly whether profits from irregular activity are to be deducted according to platform policies.
   - Ensure the player understands that game outcomes are random and generated automatically, with no manual influence by staff.

9. **Follow up on unresolved or flagged accounts**
   - If further investigation is needed, escalate the case to the appropriate department or team.
   - Monitor the account for ongoing irregular activity and ensure compliance with platform policies before allowing withdrawals or further play.

## Notes
- Thresholds for detection and specific actions depend on the current site's configuration and official rules; follow the latest available guidelines.
- Any deduction of profits or account suspension will be executed in accordance with the platform’s fair-play and anti-fraud policies, which are subject to change.

## Common questions
- The detection of irregular betting activity is automated and occurs in real-time based on system monitoring.

- Balances may temporarily freeze in case of system errors or irregular activity detection but will be restored once issues are resolved.
- Players are advised to complete betting requirements via designated game types before completing withdrawals, especially if irregular activity is suspected.
- Actions such as profit deductions or account suspensions are based on platform policies and determined by the current configuration and official rules.
