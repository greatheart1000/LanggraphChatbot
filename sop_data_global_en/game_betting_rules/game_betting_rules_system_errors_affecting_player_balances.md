# Game & Betting Rules - System Errors Affecting Player Balances

## Steps

1. **Collect player information and details of the issue**
   - Ask the player to describe the problem, including when the balance discrepancy or loss was noticed.
   - Determine if the issue occurred during gameplay, system maintenance, or other specific circumstances.
   - Inquire if there was any system error message, freeze, or failure reported by the player.

2. **Verify the player's account status and recent activity**
   - Check the player's current balance against activity logs to identify any discrepancies.
   - Review recent transactions, bets, and outcomes to determine if the issue is related to gameplay, system maintenance, or technical errors.
   - Identify if the problem coincides with known system downtime, maintenance, or specific game provider issues.

3. **Identify if the system error is related to ongoing maintenance or provider issues**
   - Check for reports of system or game provider maintenance that might temporarily affect balances.
   - Confirm whether the affected game or provider is currently under maintenance or experiencing technical errors.

4. **Assess whether the balance issue is caused by technical errors or system faults**
   - If the issue occurred during provider maintenance or known system errors, proceed to automatic recovery steps.
   - If balances are missing or frozen due to technical errors, recognize that funds are safe and will be restored automatically when the issue is resolved.
   - Check whether the balance freeze or disappearance is temporary and linked to game/system errors.

5. **Advise the player on automatic resolution procedures**
   - Inform the player that balances affected by system errors are typically restored automatically once the technical issue is fixed.
   - Recommend refreshing or reloading the account to view updated balances.
   - Emphasize that funds remain safe and are not lost or manipulated if affected by system errors.

6. **Instruct to wait for system resolution and verify after resolution**
   - If a system or provider error is confirmed, advise the player to wait until the maintenance or technical issue is resolved.
   - After some time, instruct the player to refresh their account or balance page to verify if the funds are restored.
   - Reconfirm the account balance after the system fix is announced or observed.

7. **Record the incident and the resolution process**
   - Log the details of the issue, including the time reported, affected game/provider, and actions taken.
   - Document the automatic restoration of funds once the system error is resolved.

8. **Follow up with the player if the balance has not been restored after a reasonable period**
   - If the balance is still missing or frozen after the expected resolution time, escalate to technical or back-office support.
   - Confirm whether the issue is ongoing, and advise the player to check official announcements or contact support for updates.

- Exact thresholds or times for resolution depend on the current site's configuration and official maintenance schedules; always follow the latest official guidelines.
- When applicable, inform the player that all game outcomes generated during system errors remain fair and unaffected, as outcomes are produced by RNG and system processes.
