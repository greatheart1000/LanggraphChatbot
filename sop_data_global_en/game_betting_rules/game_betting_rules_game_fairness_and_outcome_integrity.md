# Game & Betting Rules - Game Fairness and Outcome Integrity

## Steps

1. **Identify the nature of the inquiry or issue related to game fairness or outcome**  
   - Determine if the player is questioning the randomness of game results, possible manipulation, or encountering a stuck/stuck funds issue during gameplay.

2. **Collect relevant account and game details from the player**  
   - Verify the player's account status and recent activity.  
   - Confirm the specific game played, including the game type and the time of play.  
   - Request details about any issues encountered, such as frozen or stuck funds, or doubts about fairness.

3. **Explain the fundamental principle of game outcome randomness**  
   - Inform the player that all game outcomes are generated automatically by a system using a certified random number generator (RNG).  
   - Clarify that outcomes are completely determined by chance and cannot be manually influenced or manipulated by staff or players.

4. **Assure that the fairness of the games is maintained through system protocols**  
   - State that all games are operated with systems that are regularly audited and licensed according to the regulatory authority governing the platform.  
   - Emphasize that game results are generated randomly and outcomes are not predetermined or fixed.

5. **Verify the occurrence of any issues with game results or funds**  
   - Check the system for any reports of frozen or stuck funds during gameplay or at the conclusion of play.  
   - If funds are frozen or stuck, confirm that they will automatically transfer back to the player's main wallet or account balance.  
   - Advise the player to refresh their account or wallet to view updated balances.

6. **Review any player concerns about potential system manipulation or unfair results**  
   - Reiterate that all game outcomes rely on RNG and are not manually programmed or manipulated.  
   - Confirm that the system's integrity is maintained through adherence to licensing, responsible gaming practices, and regular external audits.

7. **Discuss specific queries regarding game fairness or results**  
   - For questions about guaranteed wins or predictable results:  
     - Clarify that outcomes are random and no wins are guaranteed.  
     - Inform that winnings depend on luck, and outcomes are unpredictable.  
   - For questions about the fairness and randomness of specific game types:  
     - Reiterate that all such games are computer-generated, and outcomes are determined by a certified RNG.  
     - Emphasize that the results are automatically recorded and cannot be manually manipulated, ensuring fairness.

8. **Highlight the importance of responsible gaming and compliance**  
   - Remind the player that all game results are based on chance; playing responsibly is encouraged.  
   - Mention that for any suspected irregularities, players can contact support for further review, where applicable.

9. **Provide guidance on learning and understanding game rules**  
   - Suggest that players consult in-game help or settings for explanations of game rules and how outcomes are generated, if available.

10. **Document and escalate if necessary**  
    - Record the details of the inquiry, including the game involved and the issue reported.  
    - If a technical issue is suspected, escalate to the relevant technical or compliance team as per internal procedures.
