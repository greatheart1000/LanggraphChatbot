# Game & Betting Rules - Withdrawal Turnover Fulfillment

## Steps

1. **Inform the player of the requirement to fulfill the turnover**  
   - Explain that a certain wagering or betting requirement must be completed before a withdrawal can be processed.  
   - Clarify that only bets placed on designated eligible games (e.g., slot or fish games) count toward this requirement.  
   - Mention that bets on non-eligible games (e.g., live games, certain other game types) do not contribute to the turnover.

2. **Verify the player's current status and remaining turnover**  
   - Check the player's account to determine if there is an active turnover requirement for their deposit, bonus, or promotion.  
   - Record the remaining amount or the status of the turnover requirement as per the system's latest update.

3. **Communicate the amount of remaining turnover to the player**  
   - Inform the player of the current remaining amount they need to wager to meet the requirement.  
   - Advise that only bets on eligible games will reduce this remaining amount.

4. **Instruct the player to continue playing eligible games**  
   - Guide the player to wager on designated game types (e.g., slot or fish games).  
   - Emphasize that all bets in these games, whether won or lost, will count towards decreasing the remaining turnover.  
   - Warn that bets on ineligible games (e.g., live games) do not contribute to the turnover.

5. **Monitor the player's ongoing bets**  
   - Ensure that the player continues placing bets on eligible games until the remaining turnover reaches zero.  
   - If the system detects irregular or abnormal betting activity, withdrawals may be delayed or canceled.  
   - Allow a suitable waiting period after bets are placed for the system to update the turnover status.

6. **Verify the completion of the turnover requirement**  
   - Once the system indicates that the remaining turnover is fully met or zero, confirm the status with the player.  
   - Ensure that no other conditions (such as abnormal betting or review of recent bets) are preventing withdrawal.

7. **Process the withdrawal request**  
   - Proceed with the standard withdrawal procedures once the turnover requirement is fulfilled.  
   - Ensure that the withdrawal adheres to the platform’s processing policies and that sufficient verification is completed if necessary.
