# System & Technical Issues - Game and Funds Availability During Maintenance

## Steps

1. **Identify and confirm the type of maintenance being experienced**:
   - Determine if the issue is related to platform/system maintenance, game-specific maintenance, or provider maintenance.
   - Verify if the maintenance is scheduled or unexpected, and check the official communication channels or status updates for maintenance windows.

2. **Collect relevant information from the player**:
   - Ask if they are experiencing issues accessing the platform, specific game(s), or performing transactions such as deposits or withdrawals.
   - Inquire about the specific game or service affected, including whether they see any error messages or if the game/page is loading slowly or not at all.
   - Check if the player notices their balance or funds have changed unexpectedly or are missing.

3. **Verify the player's current activity status**:
   - Confirm if the player has ongoing transactions (deposits, withdrawals, or in-game bets) at the time of the issue.
   - Determine if the player’s balance was recently updated or if there are pending transactions.

4. **Check internal system or back-office status**:
   - Consult the system status or maintenance schedule documentation to verify if the affected service or game is under scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.
   - Confirm whether balances or transactions in the affected area are temporarily frozen or delayed due to maintenance.

5. **Explain the impact of maintenance to the player**:
   - Inform the player that during platform, game, or provider maintenance, access to certain services may be temporarily unavailable.
   - Clarify that balances in affected games or sections may be temporarily frozen or not updated in real time.
   - Reassure the player that all funds are secured and will be automatically restored or credited back once maintenance is complete.

6. **Advise the player on appropriate actions during maintenance**:
   - Encourage patience and advise waiting until the scheduled or ongoing maintenance is completed.
   - If the balance appears pending or not updated, inform the player that the system will automatically credit or restore funds after the maintenance ends.
   - Suggest trying to refresh or revisit the site after some time or check for official status updates regarding maintenance completion.

7. **Assist with specific issues related to frozen or missing balances**:
   - For balances within games under maintenance, inform the player that their in-game funds are temporarily frozen. Once maintenance is finished, the balance will be automatically restored.
   - For funds potentially stuck or not reflecting post-maintenance, advise the player to wait for the automatic reconciliation.
   - If funds are not credited back after maintenance, escalate the issue to the appropriate support tier for further investigation.

8. **Guide the player on alternative methods or channels if applicable**:
   - If applicable, suggest using alternative URLs or access points if website access issues persist.
   - Recommend using supported alternative payment or wallet channels during periods of instabilities or delays, where applicable according to official policies.

9. **Record the incident details**:
   - Document the time and nature of the maintenance or issue reported.
   - Record the player's account details and the specific affected service or transaction.
   - Note if the issue is resolved naturally after maintenance or if escalation is required.

10. **Follow up and confirm resolution**:
    - Check if the player’s funds or balances have been restored after the maintenance period.
    - Confirm that the player can now access the services or games without issues.
    - If issues persist after the scheduled maintenance or the expected period, escalate accordingly with detailed notes.

## Notes

- The exact thresholds and timing for balance auto-restoration depend on each site's configuration and official maintenance policies.
- During maintenance, system delays or temporary unavailability are expected; patience is advised.
- Always verify the current site’s official communication for scheduled vs. unscheduled maintenance and follow their specific instructions.

## Common questions

- **What should I do if my balance or funds are missing during maintenance?**  
  Wait for the maintenance to complete, as funds are secured and will be automatically credited back.

- **Can I still make deposits or withdrawals during maintenance?**  
  Deposits and withdrawals may be delayed. Use alternative payment channels supported by the platform if applicable.

- **What if my game or website is not loading?**  
  Refresh the page, check your internet connection, or try an alternative URL if provided. If the issue persists, wait until maintenance is announced as complete.

- **Are funds safe during maintenance?****  
  Yes. All funds are secured during maintenance periods, and any frozen balances are automatically restored after the process concludes.
