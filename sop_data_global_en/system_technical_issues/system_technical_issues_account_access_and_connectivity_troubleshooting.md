# System & Technical Issues - Account Access and Connectivity Troubleshooting

## Steps

1. **Gather player information**
   - Ask the player to describe the issue in detail.
   - Request any relevant screenshots or error messages displayed on their device or browser.
   - Confirm the player's account details (username, email, etc.) and the specific system or game affected.
   
2. **Verify system and account status**
   - Check for any ongoing system maintenance or known outages applicable to the site or platform.
   - Confirm if any account restrictions, lockouts, or pending verification steps apply to the player's account.
   
3. **Instruct the player on initial troubleshooting steps**
   - Advise the player to restart their device or refresh their app/browser.
   - Suggest clearing cache and cookies if using a web browser, or deleting app data and reinstalling the latest version if using the app.
   - Remind the player to ensure they are using the official app or supported browser, removing outdated versions or conflicting files before reinstallation.
   - Advise disabling VPNs or proxy services if in use, as they can interfere with access.
   
4. **Check internet and network connection**
   - Instruct the player to switch between mobile data and WiFi to test connection stability.
   - Recommend toggling airplane mode to refresh network connectivity.
   - Confirm the device shows a strong network signal, and in the case of mobile data, ensure messages/SMS are received properly if needed for verification.
   
5. **Address OTP and verification-related issues**
   - Advise the player to wait for a sufficient time if OTP or verification code delivery is delayed.
   - Recommend restarting the device, checking network signal, or toggling airplane mode if OTP delays occur.
   - Confirm the player's device can receive messages if OTP is sent via SMS.
   - Suggest waiting according to the maximum time configured for code delivery before requesting a new code.
   
6. **In case of login failure or errors**
   - Recommend verifying the account credentials for correctness.
   - Instruct the player to attempt login via different methods if available (app vs. web).
   - Suggest trying alternate supported browsers if web login issues persist.
   - If login issues continue, request a screenshot of the error message for further analysis.
   
7. **Check for connectivity issues during gameplay or transactions**
   - If the player reports issues with game access or failed transactions:
     - Confirm the absence of known site or system disruptions.
     - Suggest switching to alternative deposit or withdrawal channels supported by the platform, if applicable.
     - Advise waiting if system delays or high transaction volume are suspected; do not repeatedly submit requests.
     - For persistent issues, request a screenshot and escalate to technical support.
   
8. **Escalate to support when necessary**
   - If troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issue:
     - Collect all relevant information, including screenshots, device details, and error descriptions.
     - Advise the player to contact customer support, providing the collected details.
     - Follow site-specific procedures for further investigation and resolution.
   
9. **Advise on alternative access if site-specific issues occur**
   - If access to the primary site is blocked or unavailable, suggest using any supported alternative URLs or fallback links, if provided.
   - Make sure players understand that exact URLs may vary and to refer to the latest official communications for updates.
   
10. **Ensure safety and compliance**
    - Remind players not to share personal or account details with third parties.
    - Advise following site policies on device security and verified app sources.

## Notes

- Thresholds for delays or failures (e.g., OTP delivery time, transaction delay duration) depend on the current site’s configuration and official policies.
- Always verify whether there are ongoing system issues or maintenance windows before proceeding with troubleshooting.
