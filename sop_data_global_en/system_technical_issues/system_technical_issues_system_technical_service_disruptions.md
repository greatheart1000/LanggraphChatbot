# System & Technical Issues - System & Technical Service Disruptions

## Steps

1. **Collect information from the player**
   - Ask if they are experiencing issues with deposits, withdrawals, balance updates, in-game balance, or receiving OTP codes.
   - Determine the specific problem described (e.g., balance not reflecting, OTP not received, game freeze, photo upload issues).

2. **Verify the player's account and device status**
   - Confirm the player's current device and connection type (mobile, WiFi, mobile data).
   - Check if the player reports network issues, such as signal strength or restrictions affecting message delivery.
   
3. **Advise player on basic troubleshooting steps**
   - For OTP issues:
     - Suggest restarting the device.
     - Check SIM network signal.
     - Toggle airplane mode.
     - Switch between WiFi and mobile data.
     - Wait approximately 30 minutes before retrying.
   - For issues with photo uploads:
     - Instruct to grant full access to photos and videos in device settings for the app.

4. **Handle system maintenance or known technical issues**
   - Inform the player that during scheduled maintenance or ongoing technical errors:
     - Deposits and withdrawals may be delayed.
     - Balances may appear stuck or not update immediately.
     - Game balances may be temporarily frozen or show as missing.
   - Assure that funds are secure and will be restored once the system is operational.

5. **Check for technical errors affecting game balances or transactions**
   - If the player reports a game-related balance issue or freeze:
     - Explain that technical issues can cause temporary freeze of in-game balances.
     - Confirm that all funds are safe.
     - Inform that technical teams are working to resolve the problem.
     - Advise that, once resolved, the balance will be automatically restored to the player's wallet.

6. **Verify deposit and withdrawal status**
   - Confirm whether the player has pending transactions.
   - Explain that during maintenance or technical disruptions, such transactions may be delayed, but funds remain secure.
   - Instruct to wait for system resolution and avoid multiple submissions.

7. **Assist with OTP delivery issues**
   - Ask the player to check signal strength and network restrictions.
   - Recommend switching SIM operators if possible.
   - Suggest trying to request the OTP again after ensuring signal quality.
   - If the OTP still does not arrive:
     - Advise contacting support with account verification if supported by the site.
     - Note that delays may be due to provider network issues and may resolve over time.

8. **Decide on resolution or escalation**
   - If issues persist beyond expected resolution times:
     - Verify if the problem is related to system maintenance, technical errors, or network restrictions.
     - Advise the player to wait until the technical team completes ongoing fixes.
     - Escalate the case to technical support if issue remains unresolved and is confirmed to be system-related.

9. **Provide reassurance and documentation**
   - Reassure the player that funds and balances are safe.
   - Inform that all issues are addressed according to the current site's policies and configurations.
   - Document the player's reported issue, steps taken, and any recommended follow-up actions.

## Notes
- Exact thresholds for delays or freezes depend on the specific configuration and policies of each site.
- System maintenance schedules and technical issue resolution times may vary; always verify with the latest official information.
- Player instructions should be aligned with the support guidelines of each site, especially regarding communication and escalation procedures.

## Common questions
- Does the balance update immediately after maintenance or technical fixes?  
  *Balances may be temporarily frozen or delayed; they will be updated once the system is fully restored.*
- Is my funds safe if I experience a technical error?  
  *Yes, all funds are secure and will be restored once the issue is resolved.*
- What should I do if I cannot receive OTPs?  
  *Follow troubleshooting steps such as restarting, switching networks, and re-requesting the code; if unresolved, contact support.*
