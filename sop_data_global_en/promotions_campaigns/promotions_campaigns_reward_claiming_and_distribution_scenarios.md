# Promotions & Campaigns - Reward Claiming and Distribution Scenarios

## Steps

1. **Identify the type of promotion or reward being claimed**
   - Determine whether the reward is a scheduled weekly, monthly, special event, daily check-in, or other campaign-based reward.
   - Confirm if the reward is eligible for the player's account based on the promotion's timing and requirements.

2. **Verify the claim timing and eligibility window**
   - Confirm the current date and time align with the specified claim period for the promotion (e.g., designated day and time window).
   - Ensure the player has met any specific login or activity requirements (e.g., logged in on the designated day, visited the Rewards Center, completed initial steps).

3. **Collect necessary player information**
   - Gather relevant identifiers, such as login credentials, registration details, payment methods used, or activity history.
   - Verify the player's account is active and eligible for reward claiming per platform policies.

4. **Perform system checks for duplicate or suspicious activity**
   - Check for duplication involving key identifiers such as IP address, payment details, or contact information.
   - Confirm no repeated claims from the same identifiers if rules specify single-claim policies.
   - Be aware that multiple accounts or attempts involving the same identifiers may lead to reward confiscation or disqualification.

5. **Verify activity and fulfillment requirements**
   - Confirm the player has completed necessary deposit amounts, turnover, or other activity milestones, if applicable.
   - Ensure the player has met activity thresholds such as deposit frequency or game engagement, according to site policies.

6. **Check the player's activity on designated platforms or features**
   - Verify that they engaged in allowed games, spins, or activities (e.g., participating in designated games for special rewards).
   - Confirm the player has fulfilled special event requirements, such as losing a certain amount on specified games if applicable.

7. **Proceed with reward or prize allocation**
   - If the player is eligible based on all checks, initiate reward distribution via the standard process.
   - For automated rewards, ensure the system automatically credits the reward to the player's account.
   - For manual or review-required rewards, escalate for approval or further validation.

8. **Communicate the outcome to the player**
   - Confirm successful reward claiming and inform the player of any additional conditions or next steps.
   - If the claim is invalid due to ineligibility, suspicious activity, or timing issues, clearly explain the reason based on current rules.

9. **Document the transaction or claim**
   - Record all relevant details of the claim, including identifiers checked, checks performed, and resolution outcome.
   - Store logs as per internal policies for auditing, especially if disputes or investigations arise.

10. **Implement necessary sanctions or confiscations if rules are violated**
    - If duplicate claims or violations are detected, confiscate rewards and profits per policy.
    - Notify relevant departments if further action or review is needed.

## Notes
- Exact thresholds, claim windows, and specific activity requirements may vary by site; always follow current site's configured parameters and official policies.
- Automated detection of duplicated activity involving key identifiers is common and may result in reward confiscation.
- System detection of repeated activity from the same IP address, bank card, or phone number will lead to forfeiture of rewards and profits.
- For special events involving games participation (e.g., certain spins), ensure activity minimums are met before distributing rewards.
- When handling manual validations, adhere strictly to the documented policies and ensure proper record-keeping.

## Common questions
- Eligibility depends on the current promotion rules, timing, and activity fulfillment.
- Rewards may be automatically credited or require manual approval depending on the promotion type.
- Repeated activity from the same identifiers can lead to confiscation of rewards and profits according to site policies.
- Specific thresholds for deposits, activity, or game participation are determined by the current site configuration and official rules.
- In cases of suspicion or violation, the reward will be forfeited, and additional disciplinary actions may be taken.
