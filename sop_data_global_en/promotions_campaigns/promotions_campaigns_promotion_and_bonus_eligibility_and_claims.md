# Promotions & Campaigns - Promotion and Bonus Eligibility and Claims

## Steps

1. **Player requests promotion or bonus information.**
   - Collect the player's eligibility details: ensure the player understands they must meet specific deposit, wagering, or other requirements as outlined in the current site's promotion rules.
   - Confirm if the promotion requires manual claim via the designated promotion or rewards section.
   - Advise the player to check the promotions page or Rewards Center for available offers and instructions.

2. **Verify if the promotion or bonus is currently available and applicable.**
   - Check the player's eligibility based on the promotion's criteria, such as:
     - Registration date (for new user offers)
     - Specific deposit amount (if applicable)
     - Timing (e.g., day-specific bonuses)
     - Player’s account status
   - Note: Promotions may have limited time frames (e.g., weekly, monthly) or specific login times.

3. **Instruct the player to review the promotion’s guidelines.**
   - Ensure the player reads the full terms and conditions in the promotion section.
   - Confirm they understand any special rules, such as:
     - How to claim the bonus
     - Requirements for activating the bonus
     - Any restrictions on eligible games or deposit methods

4. **Assist the player in initiating the claim process if required.**
   - For manually claimed bonuses:
     - Guide the player to the Rewards Center or promotion page.
     - Instruct them to click the designated button (e.g., “Claim,” “Go,” or similar).
     - If applicable, advise to take a screenshot of the bonus details from the promotion page for verification or support purposes.
   - For automatically distributed bonuses:
     - Inform the player the bonus will be credited without manual action, provided eligibility criteria are met.
     - Confirm the timing (e.g., within a certain number of hours).

5. **Verify the player's deposit and activity history if relevant.**
   - Confirm the deposit amount meets the minimum or maximum thresholds, if specified.
   - Check if the player has used the correct payment channels supported by the platform.
   - Ensure no violations of rules such as multiple accounts, same IP address, or binding the same bank card or phone number, which could invalidate the bonus.

6. **Check if any additional conditions are met.**
   - Confirm the player has completed any necessary wagering, playthrough, or turnover as per the promotion rules.
   - Verify that the activity was conducted on eligible games or within eligible timeframes.

7. **Decide on the bonus or promotion eligibility.**
   - If all conditions are satisfied:
     - Confirm the bonus has been successfully claimed or will be credited accordingly.
     - Inform the player of any further actions needed to receive the bonus (e.g., meet wagering requirements).
   - If conditions are not met:
     - Explain reason(s), such as incomplete deposit, insufficient activity, or eligibility restrictions.
     - Advise on steps to meet requirements or clarify that the bonus cannot be granted.

8. **Resolve any issues or discrepancies.**
   - If the bonus has not been credited when expected:
     - Verify that the player followed all claim procedures.
     - Check for system or processing delays.
     - Ensure no violation of site policies (e.g., multiple accounts).
     - Contact support or back office procedures if necessary, referencing the player's submission and screen captures if available.

9. **Document the transaction and outcome.**
   - Record relevant details for audit and customer service tracking:
     - Player account info
     - Promotion involved
     - Deposit and activity records
     - Claim timestamps
     - Any system checks performed
     - Outcome of the eligibility check

## Notes

- The specific thresholds, timing, and detailed conditions may vary between sites; always follow the current site's official rules and configurations.
- Promotions typically use system-generated bonuses, and manual adjustments are generally not allowed unless specified.
- Violations such as multiple accounts, binding the same payment methods, or repetitive IP use can lead to disqualification or cancellation of bonuses and profits.

## Common questions

- **How do I determine if a player is eligible for a promotion?**  
  Verify deposit amounts, timing, activity on eligible games, and compliance with site policies.

- **What should I do if a bonus is not credited as expected?**  
  Confirm the player followed claim procedures, checked eligibility, and that no policy violations occurred. If all checks pass, escalate to support or back office.

- **Can players claim the same promotion multiple times?**  
  Generally, promotions are limited to once per player or per account, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

- **What restrictions can invalidate a bonus?**  
  Multiple accounts, usage of the same IP or payment methods, or violation of specific game or activity rules.

- **Are bonuses automatically credited or manually claimed?**  
  Both methods exist; follow the promotion instructions provided on the site or in the Rewards Center.
