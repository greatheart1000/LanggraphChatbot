# Promotions & Campaigns - Promotion Claiming and Eligibility Procedures

## Steps

1. **Identify the promotion or bonus to be claimed or verified.**  
   - Check the relevant promotions or rewards page within the platform’s interface.  
   - Confirm if the promotion has specific time windows, days, or activity requirements.

2. **Gather player information necessary to verify eligibility.**  
   - Request the player's account details such as username or account ID.  
   - Confirm the player's registration status, mobile verification, and recent activity.  
   - Ask if the player has completed any required verification steps (e.g., identity verification).  
   - Inquire about deposit history, especially if the promotion requires minimum deposit(s) or activity.  
   - Verify if the player has used relevant channels (e.g., app download, official platform entry).

3. **Check for system or backend restrictions on claiming rewards.**  
   - Review whether the player's account has any flags such as multiple accounts, suspicious activity, or IP/digital device restrictions.  
   - Confirm if the promotion is limited to certain days, times, or activity sequences.  
   - Check if the promotion is limited per IP address, device, or other identifiers.  
   - Verify that the player has not already claimed the reward for the current eligible period (if once-only).

4. **Verify the player's actions or compliance with promotion rules.**  
   - Confirm if they have met deposit, betting, or other activity thresholds as per current promotion terms.  
   - Check if they have completed required tasks such as downloading the official app or performing specific actions.  
   - Ensure they have used the correct promo code if applicable, and entered it properly.  
   - Verify there are no violations of platform policies, including account sharing, fraud, or multiple claims.

5. **Decide on eligibility based on verified information and system checks.**  
   - If all criteria are met and no violations are detected, proceed to the next step.  
   - If eligibility is not confirmed, explain the reason(s), referencing promotion rules or restrictions.  
   - Note that specific thresholds, times, and rules may vary by site; follow the current site's official configurations.

6. **Process the reward or promotion claim.**  
   - For automatic bonuses:  
     - Confirm that the bonus has been credited to the correct account within the expected timeframe.  
   - For manual claim procedures:  
     - Instruct the player to submit a request or support ticket with relevant verification (such as a screenshot of the promotion page).  
     - Review any submitted proof to verify compliance, when applicable.  
     - Approve the claim if all conditions are met and credit the reward accordingly.

7. **Inform the player of the result.**  
   - Confirm whether the claim has been successful and the reward has been credited.  
   - Explain any restrictions or conditions for withdrawal or further usage of the reward.  
   - Advise on any additional steps if requirements remain (e.g., wagering or activity).

8. **Record the transaction or claim details for internal tracking.**  
   - Log the player's details, claim time, and outcome in the system or support record.  
   - Note any irregularities or special cases, such as multiple claims or violation alerts.

## Notes

- Rewards or bonuses are usually automatically credited once eligibility is confirmed, but some promotions may require manual review or submission of supporting proof.  
- Exact account thresholds, activity requirements, and restrictions such as IP or device limits are configured per the current platform's official rules; always verify against the latest official configuration.  
- Promotions that involve codes or special tasks often specify that users must ensure proper entry and completion of steps within designated timeframes.

## Common questions

- What should I do if a player does not receive a bonus after meeting the requirements?  
  Verify the player's eligibility, check for restrictions (IP, device, timing), and confirm if the bonus was automatically credited or requires manual claim.

- How do I handle multiple accounts or suspected fraud?  
  Cross-check identifiers such as IP address, device, or personal info. Disqualify or flag accounts that violate the platform’s policies.

- Are specific numeric thresholds or times consistent across all sites?  
  No, these may vary according to the current site’s configuration; always follow the official, up-to-date rules for each platform.

- How do I verify if a player has completed the required actions such as app download or deposit?  
  Check system logs, deposits, or activity records. When needed, ask the player to provide proof or screenshots that match official requirements.

- When should I escalate a claim for manual review?  
  When the player claims a reward but eligibility cannot be confirmed automatically, or if there are irregularities, suspected fraud, or discrepancies in submitted proof.
