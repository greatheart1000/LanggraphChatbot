# Promotions & Campaigns - Promotion Eligibility and Distribution Rules

## Steps

1. **Gather player information**
   - Request the player to provide their account details, including:
     - Registered mobile phone number
     - Registered bank or payment account (if applicable)
     - Device information (e.g., device type or identifier, if relevant)
     - IP address used during current activity
     - Confirmation of account registration details (e.g., registration time, deposit history)

2. **Verify eligibility for promotional participation**
   - Check if the player has completed all required registration steps, including:
     - Mobile number verification
     - Linking of designated payment method or wallet supported by the platform
   - Confirm that the account does not violate policies such as:
     - Multiple accounts from the same IP address or device
     - Using the same bank or payment account across multiple accounts
     - Multiple accounts from the same phone number
   - Review if the player has already claimed similar promotions, considering restrictions like:
     - Limits per IP address or device
     - Frequency limits (e.g., once per period)
   - Ensure the player has fulfilled initial deposit or activity requirements as specified per promotion (if applicable).

3. **Check promotion-specific eligibility criteria**
   - Review the current promotion's official rules for:
     - Minimum deposit amounts
     - Use of specific game categories (if restrictions apply)
     - Wagering or turnover requirements (refer to current site policies)
     - Time windows for claiming or participating
     - Use of promo codes (if applicable and check for proper claim method)
   - Verify if the promotion requires manual claiming via the Rewards Center or if it is automatically distributed.

4. **Confirm no policy violations or fraud indicators**
   - Assess whether the system detects any signs of duplicate activity, such as:
     - Same IP address or device claiming multiple promotions
     - Repeated use of the same bank account or phone number across multiple accounts
     - Suspicious activity or prior violations
   - Conduct system checks to ensure the player has not been flagged for fraud or abuse.

5. **Verify whether the player’s activity meets additional conditions**
   - For specific bonuses or rewards, validate:
     - That the player has completed required deposits
     - That bets or gameplay meet the promotional requirements
     - That the player has followed participating steps (e.g., toggling promotion options during deposit, visiting Rewards Center at specified times)

6. **Determine promotion eligibility outcome**
   - If the player satisfies all criteria:
     - Confirm that bonuses or rewards will be credited either automatically or upon manual claim
     - Advise if any turnover thresholds or additional steps (such as fulfilling wager requirements) are needed before withdrawal
   - If the player is ineligible:
     - Explain the reason, including common issues such as:
       - Use of the same IP, device, or account history restrictions
       - Insufficient activity or deposit requirements
       - Violation of promotion rules or policy flags
     - Recommend the player review the official promotion rules or contact support for review if they believe there is an error

7. **Administer the bonus or promotion**
   - For eligible players:
     - Guide the player on how to claim the promotion (if manual claim is required)
     - Confirm the bonus has been credited or will be credited within the standard system timeframe
   - For ineligible players:
     - Inform the player of the specific restriction and encourage compliance with the policies
     - Specify that bonuses are distributed based on the current site's configuration and official rules

8. **Document and monitor the transaction**
   - Record the eligibility check results, including:
     - Player details
     - Checks performed
     - Final decision and reasoning
   - Monitor the promotion activity for potential fraud or abuse in line with platform policies
   - Flag accounts that repeatedly violate policies for further review or action

## Notes

- Exact thresholds for deposit, activity, or turnover may vary between sites; always refer to the latest official rules or help center of the current platform.
- Promotional distribution timing typically occurs within a defined period (e.g., 12 hours); inform players accordingly.
- Use system tools to detect duplicate activity, including IP, device, payment method, or account linking.
- Bonuses or rewards are often limited to one per IP address or device, per promotion rules.

## Common questions

- **How do I know if I am eligible for a promotion?**  
  Ensure your account details are complete, account activity meets the requirements, and your activity does not violate policies related to multiple accounts, IP, or device restrictions.

- **Why wasn't my bonus credited?**  
  Possible reasons include detection of duplicate activity via IP, device, or account information, failure to meet minimum deposit or activity requirements, or violation of promotion rules.

- **Can I claim a promotion more than once from the same IP or device?**  
  Generally, promotions are limited to one per IP address or device; attempting to claim multiple times may result in denial or disqualification.

- **What should I do if I believe I was wrongly rejected?**  
  Contact support with your account details and relevant activity evidence for review, bearing in mind site-specific policies on multiple accounts and IP detection.
