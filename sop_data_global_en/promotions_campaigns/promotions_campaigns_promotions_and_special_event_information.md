# Promotions & Campaigns - Promotions and Special Event Information

## Steps

1. **Gather promotional and event details from the player**
   - Ask the player if they are inquiring about specific promotions, campaigns, or events.
   - Collect relevant information such as the type of promotion or event they are participating in or interested in, including any provided codes or identifiers.
   - Confirm the player's current registration status and recent deposit/activity history if relevant.

2. **Identify the specific promotion or event involved**
   - Check if the player is participating in a raffle, giveaway, special event, or campaign.
   - Determine if the promotion involves specific action requirements such as deposits, spins, referrals, or artifact collection.
   - Clarify whether the promotion is ongoing and any associated event dates or time windows.

3. **Verify player's eligibility according to promotion-specific rules**
   - Confirm that the player has fulfilled prerequisites such as minimum deposit criteria or registration requirements.
   - Check if certain conditions (e.g., VIP status, registration period, or deposit frequency) are necessary to qualify for direct withdrawal or additional benefits.
   - Note that specific eligibility thresholds and conditions may vary between sites; follow the current site's official rules.

4. **Check the player's activity and deposit history**
   - Access account records to verify recent deposits, bet amounts, or other actions relevant to the promotion.
   - Confirm if the player's activity meets promotion-specific thresholds (e.g., number of deposits, deposit amounts).
   - Determine if the player qualifies for immediate reward redemption based on their activity according to the configured rules.

5. **Guide the player through redemption processes**
   - For promo codes: instruct the player to log into their account, navigate to the reward or promotion section, and input or redeem the code as per site-specific instructions.
   - For event participation (e.g., raffle, artifact collection, spinning): explain the actions needed (such as deposit, bet, or artifact crafting) and ensure the player understands any time or action constraints.
   - For daily or periodic giveaways: advise the player on the timing of claim windows and process.

6. **Perform system checks and record verification**
   - Confirm the player's participation or qualification status in the back-office system.
   - Verify the correctness of provided promo codes or entry conditions if applicable.
   - Check if the player's deposit history meets the promotion requirements for direct withdrawal eligibility or additional rewards.

7. **Decide on the resolution or guidance for the player**
   - If the player qualifies:
     - Explain the reward collection process.
     - Confirm whether the reward is deposit-based, wager-based, or account-based.
     - Advise on the next steps to claim or enjoy the reward.
   - If the player does not qualify:
     - Clearly communicate the reasons based on their activity or status.
     - Remind them of pending conditions or upcoming opportunities.
     - Clarify that specific thresholds or eligibility conditions are subject to the current site configuration and applicable rules.

8. **Address special or exceptional cases**
   - For cases involving duplicate accounts or suspicious activity, refer to site policies to prevent multiple claims.
   - For players with incomplete actions (e.g., insufficient deposits, unmet turnover), inform them of the required steps to gain eligibility.
   - When necessary, escalate the case to relevant support or compliance teams following internal procedures.

9. **Document the interaction and outcome**
   - Record the player's eligibility status, actions taken, and any instructions provided.
   - Log any issues or special circumstances for future reference or review.

## Notes

- The specific thresholds, rewards, and timing for promotions vary according to the configuration of each site; always refer to the current official rules for precise details.
- Promos are typically time-limited; ensure to check the campaign duration before informing players.
- Multiple promotions might overlap; verify which promotion the player is referencing to provide accurate guidance.
- When in doubt, direct players to the official help center or promotion details for the latest updates.
