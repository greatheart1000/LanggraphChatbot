# Platform Rules & General Information - Bonus Eligibility Restrictions and Conditions

## Steps

1. **Verify player identification and account details**  
   - Confirm that the player’s account information, including registered name and contact details, matches the submitted documentation if applicable (e.g., for birthday or ID validation).  
   - Ensure the player has completed necessary verifications, such as ID verification or account registration requirements, before proceeding.

2. **Collect necessary bonus claim information from the player**  
   - Obtain relevant details such as username, verification documents (if needed), and any required selfies.  
   - For age or birthday-related bonuses, confirm that the current date matches the player’s birthday and that all documentation (e.g., valid IDs, selfies) meet the platform’s requirements.

3. **Check for duplicate account activity and linkage restrictions**  
   - Review system alerts or flags related to multiple accounts linked to the same IP address, device, bank card, phone number, or household.  
   - Be aware that bonus eligibility may be restricted if multiple accounts are detected with these common identifiers, in accordance with the platform’s policies.  
   - Flag accounts for potential bonus ineligibility if such activity is identified.

4. **Assess geographical and regional access restrictions**  
   - Confirm whether the player’s country or region is supported according to the current platform configuration.  
   - If the player is from a restricted region, advise on potential limitations in registration or bonus eligibility.

5. **Verify if the player has met specific bonus eligibility criteria**  
   - For promotional bonuses, check if the player has completed required deposit activities, such as a minimum deposit amount or choosing the relevant promotion during deposit.  
   - For special bonuses, confirm whether the player has fulfilled any requirements, including linking specific payment methods, making a qualifying bet, or completing specific tasks such as sharing on social media or downloading the app within the designated timeframe.

6. **Validate that no disqualifying activities are detected**  
   - Confirm that the player has not engaged in disallowed actions, such as binding the same bank card to multiple accounts, using multiple accounts from the same household, or employing multiple IP addresses or devices to claim bonuses repeatedly.  
   - Check system logs and flags for any such violations or anomalies.

7. **Assess bonus claim timing eligibility**  
   - Ensure the player's request falls within the allowable claim period, such as the designated number of days after registration or the specific date for time-sensitive promotions.  
   - Confirm that all required steps or documentation have been completed within the specified timeframe.

8. **Decide eligibility based on combined checks**  
   - If all checks are satisfied and no disqualifying conditions are found, approve the bonus claim.  
   - If eligibility is compromised due to IP, device, regional restrictions, or incomplete requirements, communicate the specific reason to the player.

9. **Resolve or explain in case of ineligibility**  
   - Clearly inform the player of the reasons for bonus rejection or ineligibility, referencing relevant policies such as IP restrictions, account linkages, documentation issues, or geographical limitations.  
   - Suggest possible corrective actions if applicable (e.g., verifying identity, using a different device or IP, or waiting until certain conditions are met).

10. **Document the outcome**  
   - Record the decision and relevant findings within the internal system or player account notes for transparency and future reference.

## Notes
- Bonus restrictions often depend on current site-specific configurations, including maximum allowable claims per IP or device and regional access policies. Always refer to the latest official rules of the platform.
- Certain bonuses may require specific verification steps, such as ID submission, selfie verification, or linking of valid contact information.
- Repeated detection of activity involving the same IP address, device, bank card, or phone number may lead to bonus denial or account suspension.
- Time-sensitive bonuses (e.g., birthdays, weekly gifts) must be claimed within the designated periods; claims outside this window are typically invalid.

## Common questions
- Bonuses are generally limited per IP address or device, and multiple accounts from the same household or user may be disqualified.
- Players may need to complete verification steps like ID submission or confirming contact details to be eligible for certain promotions.
- Eligibility checks include monitoring for linked accounts, regional restrictions, and adherence to promotional rules.
- Disqualified bonus claims are usually explained by reasons such as multiple accounts, shared IPs, or incomplete verification; players are encouraged to review official policies for clarification.
