# Platform Rules & General Information - Detection and Handling of Irregular Betting Activities

## Steps

1. **Identify the suspicion of irregular betting activity or illicit behavior**  
   - Monitor system alerts for abnormal betting patterns, multiple accounts created from the same IP address, or behavior indicative of arbitrage or malicious activity.  
   - Detect suspicious activities such as repeated bonus claims from the same IP or device, irregular wager amounts, or unusual betting frequency.  
   - Be aware that the thresholds and mechanisms for detection are configured per site; refer to the current site's policies and parameters.

2. **Gather relevant information from the player involved**  
   - Collect details of the player's account, including account ID, registration data, and associated contact information.  
   - Request the player to provide supporting documentation or evidence, such as deposit receipts, transaction details, or any relevant proof if necessary.  
   - Record details of the player's current activity, including recent deposits, bets, and bonuses claimed.

3. **Run automated or manual checks in the back office / internal systems**  
   - Verify if the account has engaged in multiple account creations from the same IP address or device, in violation of promotion and bonus policies.  
   - Check for bonus claims, deposits, or withdrawals originating from the same IP or device that violate promotion restrictions.  
   - Cross-reference betting activity for irregular patterns, including arbitrage, malicious betting, or abnormal wagering behavior.  
   - Confirm whether the player has performed actions that meet the criteria for irregular or illicit activity, based on system detection parameters.

4. **Evaluate the detected activity against platform policies**  
   - Determine if the activity qualifies as irregular betting, arbitrage, or illegal betting based on system detections.  
   - Confirm that the activity involves profits or bonuses that are subject to deduction following detection of illicit behavior.  
   - Note that thresholds for illegal or irregular activity can vary between sites; follow the current site's configurations and official policies.

5. **Decide on the appropriate resolution based on findings**  
   - If irregular betting or illicit activity is confirmed:  
     - Deduct any profits or bonuses gained from these activities according to policy.  
     - Flag the account for further review or suspension if necessary.  
     - Inform the player of the deduction and the reason, referencing system detection and policies.  
   - If there is insufficient evidence or activity does not meet the threshold:  
     - Document the review and, if appropriate, clear any alerts.  
     - Communicate with the player if clarification or additional information is required.

6. **Implement necessary account actions**  
   - Deduct illicit profits or bonuses automatically if system policies support such procedures.  
   - Suspend or restrict accounts involved in confirmed illicit activity, pending further review or if mandated by policy.  
   - No account deactivation or deletion should be performed unless associated with confirmed suspicious fraudulent activity or as per the site's procedures.

7. **Record and report the incident**  
   - Log all actions taken, evidence gathered, and decisions made in the internal system for audit and compliance purposes.  
   - If required, escalate the case to higher-level compliance or oversight teams according to internal guidelines.

8. **Inform the player of the outcome**  
   - Clearly communicate the resolution, including any deductions or restrictions imposed, following the proper communication protocols.  
   - Remind the player of the importance of complying with platform rules and policies, including restrictions on bonus claims, multiple accounts, or illicit betting.

## Notes
- Specific thresholds and detection parameters vary between platforms; always adhere to the current site's configuration and official rules.  
- Bonus restrictions such as one claim per IP/device are enforced automatically by the system but should be checked if anomalies are suspected.  
- The deduction of profits from irregular activities is supported by automated detection; manual review may be required in borderline cases.

## Common questions
- The detection and thresholds for irregular betting activities are configured per site; always confirm with the current official policies.  
- When multiple accounts or bonus claims are suspected from the same IP or device, enforce restrictions and consider deductions as per platform rules.  
- Suspicion can be escalated to account suspension or further review when illicit behavior is confirmed according to system detections.
