# Platform Rules & General Information - Agent Benefits and Compensation Policies

## Steps

1. **Identify the inquiry or issue type from the player.**  
   - Determine if the player is requesting information about agent benefits, commission structures, referral validation, or compensation claims.

2. **Gather necessary player details.**  
   - Collect the player's account identifier, such as username or account number.  
   - Obtain any relevant referral or agent ID if applicable.

3. **Explain the applicable program and benefits clearly.**  
   - Inform the player that agent benefits generally include commissions from referrals, downline deposits, bets, and tier reach rewards.  
   - Clarify that specific details, including thresholds, rates, and bonus limits, depend on the current official policies of the site, so reference the latest official rules.

4. **Verify the referral or downline status using system checks.**  
   - Confirm if the referred player or downline has deposited the minimum amount required for the referral to be considered valid, as per the current site policy.  
   - Check if the referral has completed the required turnover or activity, if applicable, according to site-specific rules.

5. **Assess referral validity based on specific criteria.**  
   - Ensure the referral is not disqualified due to multiple account creation, same payment methods, IP sharing, or device reuse, as per the platform’s current configuration.  
   - Confirm the deposit amount and turnover (if applicable) meet thresholds set by the site.

6. **Determine the applicable rewards or commissions for the referral.**  
   - Based on the verified status, identify the eligible commission types, such as invite bonuses, deposit percentage, bet percentage, or tier reach bonuses.  
   - Acknowledge that exact rates and bonus limits may vary across sites; always refer to the latest site-specific policies.

7. **Check for automatic credits and claim procedures.**  
   - Confirm if commissions or benefits are automatically credited than those requiring manual claim.  
   - If manual claiming is needed, guide the player to the designated system or reward center to claim earned benefits.

8. **Advise the player on candidate actions if issues are found.**  
   - If the referral is invalid, explain possible reasons such as insufficient deposit, activity, or disqualifying factors.  
   - If the system detects multiple accounts from the same IP, device, or payment method, inform about potential disqualification or deduction of commissions.

9. **Provide guidance on subscription or ongoing benefit accumulation.**  
   - Inform the player about how ongoing activity may impact future commissions and the importance of adhering to platform rules to maintain eligibility.

10. **Document the inquiry and actions taken.**  
    - Log the player’s details, referral status, and any discrepancies or special cases for internal records, in line with privacy and policy guidelines.

## Notes
- Exact commission rates, thresholds, and bonus limits depend on the current site's configuration; refer to the latest official rules or help center for detailed figures.  
- Differences in rules may exist across platforms; ensure jurisdiction and site-specific policies are followed accordingly.

## Common questions
- How do I know if my referral qualifies for commissions?  
  Confirm the referral has met the minimum deposit and activity requirements, as per site rules, and that there are no disqualifying factors such as shared account details or IP.

- What if I haven't received my commission?  
  Check whether the referral is valid, the deposit and activity thresholds are met, and if commissions are automatically credited or require manual claim. Review the rules for claim timing and process.

- Can a referral be invalidated after some time?  
  Yes, if disqualifying behaviors are detected or thresholds are no longer met, commissions from that referral may be deducted or invalidated.

- Are there restrictions on the number of referrals?  
  The general process applies equally; site policies determine validity based on activity, account uniqueness, and compliance with rules.

- How often are benefits or commissions updated or paid?  
  Commissions may be credited automatically or on scheduled intervals, following the current platform's defined process, usually after deposit and betting activity is confirmed.
