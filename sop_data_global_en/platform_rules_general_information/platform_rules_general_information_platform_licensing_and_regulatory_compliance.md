# Platform Rules & General Information - Platform Licensing and Regulatory Compliance

## Steps

1. **Verify platform licensing and regulatory compliance**
   - Confirm that the platform operates under an appropriate gaming license issued by the designated regulatory authority (e.g., PAGCOR or equivalent).
   - Ensure the platform follows applicable laws and responsible gaming practices as per the licensing authority.

2. **Identify the nature of the player's inquiry**
   - Determine if the player is requesting information about deposits, withdrawals, bonuses, promotions, account status, or platform legitimacy.

3. **Collect relevant information from the player**
   - Gather essential details such as:
     - Player’s account identifier (e.g., username, account ID)
     - Relevant dates or specific transactions if applicable
     - Nature of the inquiry or concern
     - Player’s location or device details (if related to restrictions)
   - Clarify if the player is inquiring about specific promotions or general platform information.

4. **Check platform licensing and compliance status**
   - Confirm whether the platform in question holds a valid license in the relevant jurisdiction.
   - Verify that the licensing details match the current licensed brand or website.
   - Check if any regulatory warnings or notices are applicable.

5. **Review internal records related to the player's account**
   - Verify account status, including any restrictions or confirmed compliance with platform policies.
   - Check if the account has any noted irregular activity or violations.
   - For questions related to bonuses or promotions, confirm claim status and adherence to site-specific restrictions such as IP-based limitations or device restrictions.

6. **Assess specific compliance considerations if applicable**
   - Confirm whether the player’s activity adheres to platform rules, especially regarding bonus claims or multiple account issues.
   - Check for flagged activities such as irregular betting or attempts to exploit promotional systems, based on the platform’s policies.
   - Note that certain restrictions (e.g., deposit bonuses) may be in place according to site configurations; advise the player accordingly.

7. **Provide an appropriate resolution or explanation**
   - If the platform is licensed and compliant:
     - Affirm the legitimacy and regulated status of the platform.
     - Address the specific inquiry with standard information aligned with license protections (e.g., no refunds policy, balance during maintenance, etc.).
   - If the inquiry involves restrictions (e.g., bonus claim limitations or account restrictions):
     - Explain restrictions based on existing policies (like IP or device limitations).
   - If the platform status is unknown or non-compliant:
     - Advise the player about the importance of licensing and suggest playing only on licensed and regulated platforms.

8. **Document the inquiry and resolution details**
   - Log relevant information including player’s details, the nature of the inquiry, steps taken, and the final resolution or guidance provided.
   - Mark any follow-up actions needed, such as escalation or further verification.

9. **Inform the player accordingly**
   - Clearly communicate the verified information or resolution.
   - Remind players that official communication channels are limited to designated support (e.g., live chat, official email) and that no unsolicited calls or messages requesting personal or financial information will be made.

## Notes

- Licensing information must be verified for each platform or site; specifics may differ between brands and locations.
- Certain policies, such as bonus restrictions or activity monitoring, depend on the current site’s configurations and official rules.
- Irregular betting activity identification and related deductions are at the discretion of the platform’s internal system policies.

## Common questions
