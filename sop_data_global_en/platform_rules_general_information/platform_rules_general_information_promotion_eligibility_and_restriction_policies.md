# Platform Rules & General Information - Promotion Eligibility and Restriction Policies

## Steps

1. **Gather player identification details**:  
   - Collect the player's registered account information, including username, name, and contact details.  
   - Confirm the current device and IP address used during the interaction.

2. **Verify eligibility conditions for the promotion**:  
   - Check if the player has fulfilled any specified requirements such as account registration, registration date, or qualifying deposit amounts, in accordance with the current site's configured rules.  
   - Ensure the player has completed any necessary steps, such as verification processes (e.g., mobile number or identity verification).

3. **Check for IP or device restrictions**:  
   - Review whether the player's current IP address and device number are different from previous participation records in the promotion.  
   - Determine if there are existing accounts from the same IP address or device that could restrict eligibility, based on the current site's policies.

4. **Review existing account activity for multiple accounts or suspicious activity**:  
   - Cross-reference the player's account with internal systems to identify if multiple accounts from the same IP or device exist.  
   - Look for signs of rule violations such as creating multiple accounts, using referral links improperly, or other suspicious behaviors.

5. **Identify promotion-specific restrictions**:  
   - Confirm if the promotion is limited to one account per IP address or device, as specified in the current site's rules.  
   - Check if the player has already claimed the promotion bonus within the allowed period or number of claims.

6. **Verify deposit and betting activity**:  
   - Ensure the player’s deposit and wagering activities meet the minimum requirements for promotion eligibility, according to the current site's configured thresholds.  
   - Confirm the player has used the permitted channels, payment methods, or platforms for deposits or withdrawals.

7. **Assess additional conditions specific to the promotion**:  
   - For promotions involving participation through social media or verification steps (e.g., liking or joining official pages), verify proof of action if required, such as screenshots or confirmation messages.  
   - Check for the fulfillment of other promotion-specific tasks or rules, such as frequency or timing of claims.

8. **Determine if the player qualifies for the promotion**:  
   - Based on the above checks, if no restrictions or violations are found and all criteria are met, approve the eligibility to participate or claim bonuses.  
   - If restrictions are present (e.g., duplicate IP, multiple accounts, incomplete requirements), explain the specific reason for ineligibility or bonus denial.

9. **Explain the decision to the player**:  
   - Clearly communicate whether they are eligible or ineligible, referencing the relevant policy points such as IP/device restrictions or deposit/bet requirements.  
   - Warn about potential confiscation of rewards if violations are detected, such as sharing accounts or using improper means.

## Notes

- Exact thresholds for deposit amounts, wagering, or VIP-level restrictions vary per site; always refer to the current site’s official rules or help center for detailed criteria.  
- Promotion restrictions related to IP address or device are common; multiple accounts from the same IP or device may lead to bonus denial or account restrictions.  
- Sending screenshots or proof of actions should only be done if explicitly requested by support and according to the current site’s procedures.  
- Account activity and promotion-specific rules may differ slightly based on the promotion; verify site-specific policies before finalizing the check.  

## Common questions

- Promotion bonuses and eligibility may be limited to one per IP address or device, as per each site’s policy; multiple accounts sharing an IP or device could influence bonus eligibility.  
- Players should ensure they meet all deposit and betting requirements before claiming a promotion.  
- Efforts to create multiple accounts or misuse promotion rules may result in rewards being confiscated or account restrictions.  
- Checking for prior claims and suspicious activity is part of standard eligibility verification, with thresholds varying by site.
