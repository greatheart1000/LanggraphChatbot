# Platform Rules & General Information - E-wallet Operations and Regulatory Compliance

## Steps

1. **Verify the player's identity and account details**  
   - Collect essential identification information as required for the platform, including valid IDs and self-portrait photos holding the IDs if claiming specific bonuses.  
   - Ensure details are accurate and clear to facilitate verification processes, especially for promotional claims such as birthday bonuses.

2. **Confirm the player's location and device details**  
   - Check if the player is accessing the platform from within the permitted regions, as use outside the approved country may require the use of VPNs, which could be subject to restrictions.  
   - Note if the player is using a single device or shared devices, especially in relation to promotional limits that restrict bonuses per device or IP address.

3. **Check for any restrictions or notices regarding e-wallet services**  
   - Confirm whether there are any official directives impacting e-wallet icons or links, such as recent regulatory requirements to remove online gambling platform icons or links from e-wallet apps.  
   - Inform the player that, according to current policies, e-wallet services remain active and functional for other transactions, despite any restrictions on gambling platform visibility.

4. **Verify recent transactions and balances**  
   - Request relevant receipt or transaction details if the player reports deposits, withdrawals, or balance discrepancies made via e-wallets or digital channels.  
   - Check internal records for deposits, especially if there is a need to verify deposits made through designated e-wallet channels, and process such deposits accordingly.

5. **Assess whether the deposit or withdrawal activity complies with platform policies**  
   - Confirm that the transaction amounts meet the minimum and maximum thresholds set by the current site configuration, respecting limits on deposit and withdrawal via e-wallets or digital currencies.  
   - Verify if the payment method used (e-wallet or alternative) aligns with the accepted channels supported by the platform.

6. **Communicate potential system or activity-based deductions**  
   - Inform the player that the system may deduct profits if irregular or malicious betting activity is detected associated with their account.  
   - Clarify that all winnings and losses are automatically recorded, and manual adjustments are not made.

7. **Handle promotional claims or bonuses**  
   - For promotional claims such as birthday bonuses or event rewards, verify eligibility by checking the date of birth, submission of required identification, and the correct timing of claim submission.  
   - Note that certain bonuses or promotions are only claimable on specific days; follow the official rules for each promotion, which may vary per site.

8. **Update and reflect account changes**  
   - After completing relevant verifications or transactions, refresh the player's balance screen or account page to ensure they see the most current information.  
   - Confirm that balances are accurately reflected post-transaction or bonus application.

9. **Inform the player about ongoing regulatory or platform updates**  
   - Notify the player if there are any recent regulatory directives or system changes, such as removal of online gambling icons from e-wallet apps, which do not affect their ability to use e-wallets for other transactions.  
   - Advise on using approved payment channels supported by the platform, in accordance with current policies.

10. **Advise on access or restrictions**  
    - If the player encounters access issues related to region or IP restrictions, suggest the use of a VPN to connect from permitted locations, while noting that using VPNs may lead to access restrictions per platform policies.  
    - If access is temporarily denied due to IP blocking or security measures, advise waiting or contacting support for manual assistance.

## Notes

- The specific thresholds for deposits, withdrawals, or bonuses depend on the current site's configuration and official rules; always refer to the latest site documentation.  
- Account and transaction verification procedures should follow the platform's internal guidelines and may involve additional security checks as necessary.  
- Promotional and bonus rules, including eligibility and claim periods, are subject to change and should be verified against the current promotional policy for each site.

## Common questions

- Balance updates typically occur immediately after a transaction; if not visible, refresh the account or balance screen.  
- Restrictions on bonuses or promotions may apply based on IP address or device but are limited by site-specific configurations.  
- The removal of gambling platform icons from e-wallet apps does not impact the functionality of e-wallet services for compliant transactions.  
- Deposits via e-wallets can be verified with receipt details, and deposits are credited once validated.  
- Bonuses such as birthday promotions are claimable only on the designated day, following proper ID and selfie submissions.  
- Using VPNs or proxies may result in access issues and should be used cautiously, respecting platform policies.  
- System deductions are automatic and based on activity detection; manual adjustments are not performed, and deducted funds are not restored.
