# Platform Rules & General Information - Website Access and Alternative URLs

## Steps

1. **Identify the player's access issue or inquiry**  
   - Gather details about the specific problem, such as difficulty in accessing the main website, receipt issues, or account-related questions.  
   - Determine if the player has used the latest official channels and URLs.

2. **Verify the official website URL for the current platform**  
   - Confirm whether the player is attempting to access the designated official website URL.  
   - Educate the player to always use the latest official address, as URLs may change or have multiple supported domains.

3. **Instruct the player to try alternative website URLs if access issues persist**  
   - Refer the player to try listed alternative URLs provided for the platform.  
   - Remind the player to use alternative URLs only if the official site is inaccessible.  
   - Note: Exact alternative URL options may differ between sites; follow the current configuration.

4. **Advise the use of network solutions if access is blocked or restricted**  
   - If access is blocked or unavailable within certain regions, suggest using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to connect through a server in a supported area, where permitted by platform policy.

5. **Check for platform maintenance or service outages**  
   - Inform the player that scheduled maintenance or unexpected outages may temporarily disable access, deposit, or withdrawal functions.  
   - Advise the player to wait until maintenance is completed and to refer to official notifications for updates.

6. **Guide the player on depositing funds via appropriate channels**  
   - Confirm that they are using the officially supported wallet or payment channels.  
   - Verify that the deposit code, QR code, or method used is the latest and valid according to the platform's configured parameters.

7. **Assist in troubleshooting deposit and receipt issues**  
   - If the player reports no receipt for a deposit, confirm whether the transaction was processed successfully via the external payment provider.  
   - Inform that some methods (e.g., certain e-wallets) may not generate receipts, and advise contacting support if needed.  
   - Make sure the player does not attempt to use outdated QR codes or payment details.

8. **Check for any account activity anomalies or violations**  
   - Review whether the player might be flagged for malicious activity, arbitrage, or policy violations, which could impact access or account status.  
   - Communicate that accounts are only deactivated or restricted under specific circumstances such as malicious activity, and otherwise, they remain active.

9. **Provide guidance on account-related inquiries**  
   - For questions on deposit history, instruct the player on how to view their deposit records through the website or app interface.  
   - Clarify that account deactivation requests are generally not accepted, and instead, a new account may be created if the player no longer wishes to use the current one.

10. **Remind about platform rules and policies**  
    - Emphasize the importance of following platform rules regarding bonuses, deposits, and use of official URLs.  
    - Advise referencing the latest official help guides for detailed policies, especially regarding promotions, verification, and ongoing system updates.

## Notes

- Specific URLs, thresholds, and configuration details may vary between different sites; always confirm with the current official rules and supported links.
- During platform maintenance, funds remain secure, but access and transaction capabilities may be temporarily limited.

## Common questions

- What should I do if I cannot access the website?  
  Use the designated official URL or attempt access via supported alternative URLs.  
- How can I access the platform from outside of the supported region?  
  Use a VPN to connect to a server located in a supported region, where permitted by policies.  
- How to verify the legitimacy of the website?  
  Always access through official trusted domains and avoid fake or imitation sites.
