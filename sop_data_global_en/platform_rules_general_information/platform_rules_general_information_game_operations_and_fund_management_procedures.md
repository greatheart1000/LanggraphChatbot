# Platform Rules & General Information - Game Operations and Fund Management Procedures

## Steps

1. Collect necessary information from the player:
   - Verify the player's identity and account details.
   - Inquire about the specific issue or scenario (e.g., funds during game maintenance, suspicious activity, or withdrawal requests).
   - Confirm the transaction details involved, such as deposit, withdrawal, or game activity amounts and timestamps.
   - Ask about the timing of the issue, especially if it coincides with scheduled maintenance or platform downtime.

2. Check current platform/system status:
   - Verify if a game or platform maintenance is ongoing through internal notifications or system status updates.
   - Confirm whether the game or platform is under scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.
   - Ensure that the maintenance or downtime period has ended before proceeding with fund-related claims.

3. Review transaction or activity records:
   - Examine the player's recent transactions to identify if any funds are affected by maintenance or system issues.
   - Check for transactions that may be paused, stuck, or pending during system downtime.
   - Confirm whether funds are temporarily frozen or unavailable due to ongoing maintenance.

4. Determine the appropriate course of action based on the scenario:
   - If games or platform are under maintenance:
     - Inform the player that funds affected during maintenance will be automatically refunded or released back to their account once the maintenance concludes.
     - Assure the player of the security of their funds.
     - Advise the player to wait until the maintenance completes before taking further action.
   - If funds appear to be missing or stuck:
     - Verify if the funds are stuck in the game or system.
     - Confirm that the system will automatically return or restore such funds after maintenance or downtime.
     - Notify the player that once the system is back online, their funds will be automatically restored or refunded according to platform policy.

5. Handle suspicious activity or policy violations:
   - Check for signs of irregular activity, such as multiple accounts from the same IP, bank card, or phone number.
   - Be aware that rewards or profits may be deducted if suspicious activity is detected or policy violations are confirmed.
   - If activity breaches platform policies, follow established procedures for account suspension or further investigation.

6. Verify any ongoing or pending bonuses, promotions, or rewards:
   - Confirm eligibility based on current site policies.
   - Inform the player of any applicable requirements or restrictions.
   - If the player's current VIP status or activity affects certain bonuses, inform them that bonus policies depend on official site configuration.

7. Communicate transparently with the player:
   - Explain that game results are system-generated and outcomes are based on chance, with no manual control or guaranteed profits.
   - Clarify that all winnings and losses are automatically recorded by the system.
   - Specify that during maintenance, no game transactions or winnings are processed until the system is restored.
   - Reassure the player that funds are secure and will be returned or restored as per platform policy once the system becomes operational.

8. Advise on further actions:
   - If the player’s issue is resolved (e.g., funds returned or account restored), instruct them to check their account balance and transaction history.
   - If the issue persists or involves a dispute, escalate the case to the relevant department or support team according to internal procedures.
   - Remind the player to avoid multiple account creation, sharing, or suspicious activity to prevent potential account restrictions.

## Notes

- Policies regarding refunds and fund restoration during maintenance may differ between sites; always follow the current site’s official rules.
- Transaction limits, daily caps, or other restrictions are managed automatically; inform players accordingly if limits prevent immediate resolution.
- For promotional or bonus-related inquiries, refer to the latest official rules or help center for specific eligibility and distribution policies.
