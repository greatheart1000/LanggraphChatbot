# Platform Rules & General Information - Withdrawal and Bonus Eligibility Requirements

## Steps

1. **Verify the player's identity and account details.**  
   - Confirm the player's registered username, ensuring it meets the site’s length requirements.  
   - Check for any pending verification documents or ID submissions required for account validation.

2. **Gather withdrawal or bonus inquiry details.**  
   - Ask the player for the specific withdrawal amount or bonus eligibility concern.  
   - Confirm the current site or brand they are using, if multiple options exist.

3. **Check account eligibility for withdrawal or bonus activity.**  
   - Verify if the player has met the necessary minimum deposit or activity thresholds as specified by the current site's policies.  
   - Determine if the account is verified and compliant with KYC requirements.

4. **Review applicable turnover or wagering requirements.**  
   - For bonus-related withdrawals, consult the specific promotion’s rules to verify if the player has fulfilled the required turnover or wagering multiple.  
   - Confirm whether the player has played on eligible game types and met any wagering conditions.

5. **Check for applicable restrictions related to bonuses or promotions.**  
   - Ensure the player has not engaged in activity that would disqualify them, such as multiple accounts, binding the same bank card, using the same phone number, or logging in from the same/multiple IP addresses.  
   - Verify whether the account has any pending bonus or promotional claims that are still under qualification review.

6. **Assess withdrawal limits and restrictions.**  
   - Confirm if the requested withdrawal amount falls within the current daily, weekly, or per-transaction limits, as configured for the site.  
   - Check if the player has exceeded the maximum number of withdrawal requests permitted within the specified period.

7. **Check for any account-specific constraints.**  
   - Verify if the account is restricted due to suspicious activity, incomplete verification, or previous violations.  
   - Confirm if the account balance, including bonus funds, is eligible for withdrawal according to the platform’s rules.

8. **Determine payment method availability and compliance.**  
   - Confirm that the designated withdrawal method (bank transfer, e-wallet, etc.) is correctly linked, active, and supported by the platform.  
   - Ensure the player's withdrawal account information is properly registered and validated.

9. **Inform the player of any outstanding requirements or delays.**  
   - If turnover or wagering requirements are not met, explain that they must continue playing on eligible games until requirements are fulfilled.  
   - If the account or transaction is pending verification or approval, inform the player of processing times.

10. **Decide on the resolution based on the checks.**  
    - If all conditions are met, approve the withdrawal or bonus claim, and instruct on the next steps for processing.  
    - If conditions are not met, clearly explain the applicable restrictions, such as pending requirements, limits, or disqualifications, and advise on what the player needs to do to be eligible.

11. **Process the withdrawal or bonus claim accordingly.**  
    - For approved requests, initiate the transaction through the approved payment method.  
    - For failed or disqualified requests, provide the specific reason according to the platform’s policies and guidance on further actions.

## Notes

- Exact thresholds for deposits, wagers, and limits may vary depending on the current site configuration; always refer to the latest official rules.
- Bonus funds are generally subject to wagering requirements and may be forfeited if conditions are not met within the allotted timeframe.
- Multiple account activities, same bank card usage, and suspicious login behavior can disqualify or delay withdrawal and bonus processing.
- Verification procedures, including identity confirmation and document submission, are mandatory for high-value or suspicious transactions.
