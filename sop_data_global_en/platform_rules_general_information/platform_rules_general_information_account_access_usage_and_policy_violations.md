# Platform Rules & General Information - Account Access, Usage, and Policy Violations

## Steps

1. **Gather player information**  
   - Collect relevant details including the player's account identifier, IP address, device used, phone number, payment method, and any other identifiable data.  
   - Inquire whether the player has multiple accounts or uses referral links.

2. **Check for policy violations related to account creation and activity**  
   - Verify if multiple accounts have been created from the same IP address, device, phone number, or bank details.  
   - Confirm if there is any evidence of account sharing, transfer of credits between accounts, or use of the same payment method across different accounts in violation of policy.  
   - For use of referral links, check if multiple accounts have been generated from the same IP or other linked data, which may violate site-specific policies.

3. **Assess the status of the account**  
   - Determine if the account is active, disabled, frozen, or canceled due to violations such as bonus abuse, policy breaches, or suspicious activity.  
   - Confirm if the account has remaining balances, pending withdrawals, or deposit history.

4. **Verify compliance with platform-specific policies**  
   - Check if the player has attempted to access the platform through unauthorized URLs, VPNs, or outside the permitted region (if applicable).  
   - Ensure the account has followed rules regarding proper banking connections for withdrawals, according to site configuration.  
   - Investigate any suspicious behavior like repeated registration, use of prohibited tools, or malicious arbitrage activities.

5. **Determine actions based on findings**  
   - If multiple accounts from the same IP, device, or payment details are detected and violate policies, document the violation, and prepare to apply sanctions such as confiscation of rewards, restrictions, or account suspension.  
   - If a user is attempting to access the site using alternative URLs or VPNs, advise on permitted access methods and notify of restrictions if applicable.  
   - For accounts identified as fraudulent or involved in policy breaches, inform the player of the reason and escalate the case following internal procedures.

6. **Decide on resolution or explanation**  
   - Explain to the player that accounts cannot generally be deleted or deactivated, and that creating or maintaining multiple accounts from the same data may lead to forfeiture of balances and account sanctions per policy.  
   - Clarify that transfers between accounts are not permitted and that violation of such rules can result in account suspension or termination.  
   - If the player’s activity is approved and compliant, confirm continued access with no restrictions.

7. **Record and communicate**  
   - Log all findings, actions taken, and the rationale based on policy.  
   - Notify the player clearly about the final resolution, next steps, or restrictions applied, referencing the policies related to account access, activity, and violations.  
   - Advise on how to avoid future violations, such as using unique IP addresses/devices and adhering to platform rules.

## Notes

- Policies regarding account deletion, merging, or deactivation are generally restrictive; accounts are typically not deleted unless explicitly supported by site-specific rules.  
- Multiple accounts from the same IP or using the same payment method are common triggers for sanctions; policies may specify thresholds but default to preventing policy violations.  
- Access restrictions via VPN or alternative URLs should be communicated based on official site instructions to ensure compliant access.  
- For potential account bans due to suspicious activity, follow internal procedures for escalation and documentation according to local policies.

## Common questions

- **Can accounts be deleted or deactivated?**  
  Accounts are generally not deletable; players may uninstall or cease using them, but data remains secured. Deactivation is typically not supported to prevent abuse.

- **What if I have multiple accounts from the same IP or using referral links?**  
  Such activity may violate policies, resulting in forfeiture of rewards, suspension, or additional sanctions such as confiscation of commissions or balances.

- **How do I access the platform if I am outside the permitted region?**  
  Use authorized methods such as VPNs to connect to regional servers, following official guidelines and permitted URLs.

- **Can I transfer credits between accounts?**  
  No, transferring funds between accounts is not allowed, and violations may lead to account restrictions.

- **What happens if suspicious behavior or arbitrage is detected?**  
  Detected illicit activities result in penalties, including forfeiture of profits, rewards, and potential account restrictions or bans.

- **Are there differences across sites?**  
  Specific configurations, such as thresholds for violations, may vary; always follow the current site's official rules and policies.
