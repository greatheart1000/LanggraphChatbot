# Platform Rules & General Information - Reward Claiming and Redemption Procedures

## Steps

1. **Verify eligibility for reward claiming or redemption**:
   - Confirm that the player's account meets the specific conditions for the reward or redemption, such as completing required deposit activities, bets, or specific account activities.
   - Check any restrictions related to account sharing, multiple accounts, or linked payment methods, as violations could disqualify the player.
   - Ensure the player's wallet or balance is in a state that permits redemption, typically meaning their available wallet credit appears to be zero or as per the current platform’s configured rules.

2. **Access the appropriate reward or redemption interface**:
   - Guide the player to the designated platform area, such as the Rewards Center or Points Mall.
   - Confirm that the player is using the latest supported platform version or app, if applicable.
   - Advise refreshing the page or relaunching the app if the interface is unresponsive or if access issues occur.

3. **Identify the specific reward or points to redeem**:
   - For points redemption: check the total available points and confirm against the platform’s current conversion rates.
   - For scheduled rewards: verify the date and time (according to the platform's configured schedule) for the reward claim window.
   - Confirm that the reward or points are eligible for redemption at this time and that the player's account qualifies.

4. **Perform the redemption or claim operation**:
   - Initiate the redemption or reward claim process by clicking the corresponding button or option.
   - For points redemption: select the desired reward or balance conversion, review the details, and confirm the transaction.
   - For scheduled rewards (e.g., weekly or monthly): ensure the correct date and system recognition that the reward is available.
   - For physical or digital prizes: fill in required information such as address, full name, and contact details, as dictated by the site’s procedures.
   
5. **Complete the transaction and confirm success**:
   - Await system confirmation that the reward or redemption has been processed successfully.
   - If the platform provides a confirmation number or receipt, advise the player to save it.
   - If an error occurs, instruct the player to retry after refreshing or later, and verify back-office logs if necessary.

6. **Check for special conditions or warnings**:
   - Be aware of platform policies regarding multiple claims or repeated activity involving the same IP address, bank card, or phone number.
   - Note that claims involving repetition or suspicious activity may lead to confiscation of rewards and profits.
   - Confirm that the player has not violated any rules that could invalidate their reward, including eligibility criteria like deposit thresholds.

7. **Advise the player on processing time and further steps**:
   - Inform the player that most rewards are credited immediately, but some could require processing time as per the schedule.
   - If the reward involves an external wallet, payment method, or delivery, inform the player about the expected delivery or credit timeline.
   
8. **Document and escalate if necessary**:
   - Record the transaction and player details for audit or support purposes.
   - For unresolved issues or suspected violations, escalate to the appropriate back-office or support team according to internal procedures.

## Notes
- The specific thresholds, schedules, and VIP-related rewards are subject to the current platform configuration and may differ between sites.
- Rewards involving promotion-specific conditions or activities require checking the latest official rules or help center of the platform.
- Always verify that the player’s profile details are up to date before processing physical or digital reward deliveries.

## Common questions
- The process for claiming scheduled weekly or monthly rewards generally follows a set schedule; confirm the correct date and time for each reward type.
- Reward redistribution or subsequent bonus issuance may be contingent on the player's activity, deposit history, or VIP status, as configured per site.
- Repeated attempts or claims from the same IP address, bank card, or phone number could result in confiscation of rewards and profits, as part of anti-fraud measures.
- Conversions from reward points to in-game balance or cash are subject to the current conversion rates and eligibility criteria, such as turnover requirements.
