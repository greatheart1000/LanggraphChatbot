# Platform Rules & General Information - Referral and Bonus Program Policies

## Steps

1. **Collect initial player information:**
   - Obtain the player's unique registration or account details.
   - Verify if the player used an official registration method or referral link.
   - Check if the player has shared or registered via an agent or referral program.

2. **Verify eligibility based on registration and activity:**
   - Confirm whether the player has completed the necessary registration steps, such as number verification, if required by the current site.
   - Ensure the player has made at least the minimum deposit amount as specified in the current platform’s rules.
   - Verify that the player has placed the required qualifying bets on the same day as deposit, if applicable.

3. **Check the referral link or invitation authenticity:**
   - Confirm that the player registered via a valid referral or invitation link associated with the referring user.
   - Ensure that the player did not register multiple times from the same IP address, device, or using the same bank details if such activity is restricted.
   - Verify that the referral does not involve multiple accounts from the same IP or device, according to the platform’s rules.

4. **Assess the player's deposit and wagering activity:**
   - Check that the player's deposit meets the minimum qualifying amount.
   - Verify that the player has completed the mandated number of bets or gameplay activities within the specified period (e.g., same day or specified timeframe).
   - Ensure the deposit was completed after or during the registration via the referral link.

5. **System checks for potential violations:**
   - Review if the player has created multiple accounts from the same IP, device, phone number, or bank card to prevent disqualified referrals.
   - Detect if multiple accounts share the same IP address or device, which may impact qualification.
   - Confirm that the activity is consistent with the platform’s policies regarding multiple accounts, IP restrictions, or other anti-fraud measures.

6. **Determine the validity of the referral or bonus claim:**
   - Check if all conditions for the referral or bonus program are met:
     - Player registered and deposited as required.
     - Completed the minimum deposit and bet amounts.
     - Number verification (if applicable) has been done before depositing or playing.
   - Make sure that the referral or bonus is not disqualified under the platform’s rules (e.g., same IP, multiple accounts, or non-compliance with minimum activity).

7. **Decide on the appropriate resolution or explanation:**
   - If conditions are met and there are no violations:
     - Approve the bonus or referral reward.
     - Confirm that the reward can be credited automatically or manually, as per internal procedures.
   - If the conditions are not met:
     - Provide the player with a clear explanation that the referral or bonus does not qualify due to unmet criteria or policy violations.
     - Inform them of specific reasons, such as activity not meeting minimum requirements or system detection of multiple accounts or duplicate activity.

8. **Proceed with reward distribution or denial:**
   - For approved cases:
     - Process the automatic or manual crediting of bonuses or commissions in accordance with the current site's configuration.
   - For disqualified cases:
     - Advise the player to review the relevant platform rules.
     - Document the decision for record-keeping and potential further review.

## Notes

- Always refer to the latest official policies or rules for thresholds and configurations, as these may vary between sites.
- Be aware that certain promotional rewards or bonuses (e.g., special campaigns or milestone bonuses) may have additional or different criteria; verify against current official rules.
- System automation often handles rebate, rebate, and reward processing, but manual checks are required where applicable.
- Additional restrictions may apply, such as device or IP restrictions for ongoing promotions or specific reward types.

## Common questions

- What should I do if a player claims a referral bonus but does not meet the requirements?
  - Verify the player’s activity and system logs to confirm deposit, wagering, and registration details. Explain any unmet criteria or policy violations clearly.
  
- How do I identify potential multiple accounts or suspicious activity?
  - Review system flags related to duplicate IP addresses, devices, bank details, or phone numbers, and cross-reference registration timestamps and activity logs.

- When are bonuses typically credited?
  - Bonuses are usually credited automatically once the platform’s conditions are verified as met; otherwise, manual processing is performed following internal procedures.

- Are there any restrictions to sharing referral links?
  - Referral links must be used by unique individuals following the platform’s policies; creating multiple accounts or using fake information may lead to disqualification of the referral and forfeiture of rewards.
