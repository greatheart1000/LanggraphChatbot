# Identity Verification & Compliance - KYC Document Submission and Verification

## Steps

1. **Initiate the verification process**  
   - Determine if the purpose is related to account creation, transaction security, withdrawal, deposit verification, password reset, or account recovery.  
   - Notify the player about the requirement to submit the necessary documents for verification.

2. **Collect required player information**  
   - Request and record the player's username.  
   - Ask for their full name, registered contact details (email and phone number).  
   - Confirm the current account balance (if applicable).  
   - Verify the last game played or recent transaction details if needed.

3. **Request and verify identity documents**  
   - Instruct the player to provide clear images of their valid government-issued ID (front and back).  
   - Request a selfie of the player holding their ID card, ensuring the ID is clearly visible and the photo is recent and unblurred.  
   - Confirm that the ID details match the provided account information.  
   - For certain verifications, a screenshot of the linked e-wallet or payment profile may be required.

4. **Collect proof of recent deposit or transaction (if applicable)**  
   - Obtain a screenshot or document showing the latest deposit transaction (e.g., deposit receipt, payment confirmation).  
   - Ensure the document shows relevant details such as amount, date, and time matching the records.  
   - Note that only specific formats (e.g., inbox receipts, transaction histories from supported channels) are accepted.

5. **Verify uploaded documents and information**  
   - Check that images are clear, with visible ID details, and that selfie holds the ID close to the face.  
   - Confirm that date and details on deposit/slip receipts match system records.  
   - Ensure uploaded files do not exceed the maximum file size specified in the current platform policy.

6. **Perform internal system checks**  
   - Cross-reference the submitted documents and information with system records.  
   - Verify that the receipt details (reference number, date, time) match the transaction logs.  
   - Confirm that the ID and related information are consistent across all submitted documents.

7. **Assess verification outcome**  
   - If all documents and checks pass, approve the verification, update the player's account status accordingly, and notify the player of successful verification.  
   - If any document is unclear, mismatched, or missing, inform the player of the issue and request resubmission or clarification.  
   - For discrepancies such as name mismatches or failed document quality, explain that verification cannot be completed until resolved.

8. **Handle site-specific variations and special cases**  
   - Follow the current site's configuration for thresholds, thresholds, or additional requirements, as these may vary.  
   - If a player cannot provide certain documents, advise on alternative verification options if available (e.g., additional ID forms or re-submission).  
   - For deposit verification, only specific receipts (e.g., inbox receipts from supported channels) are accepted; clarify if different formats are provided.

9. **Complete the verification process**  
   - Record the verification status in the back office or system logs.  
   - Notify the player of the outcome, whether approved or requiring further action.  
   - For approved verifications, lift any account restrictions and enable full access to features as applicable.

## Notes
- Always ensure document images are clear and legible.  
- Verification timeframes may vary according to the current platform policies and workload; inform the player accordingly.  
- Respect data privacy and handle all submitted documents in compliance with data security standards.

## Common questions
- Thresholds and specific document requirements may differ depending on the platform's current policies; always refer to the latest official guidelines or support instructions.  
- For missing or incompatible documents, advise players to contact support for further assistance or alternative options.  
- Only documents in supported formats and within size limits are valid for submission.
