# Identity Verification & Compliance - Withdrawal and Deposit Verification Procedures

## Steps

1. **Gather Player Information**
   - Request the following details from the player:
     - Account username
     - Full name
     - Registered email address
     - Verified phone number
     - Last game played (if applicable)
     - Current account balance
     - Payment method details (e-wallet number or bank account, if applicable)
     - Contact details used during the transaction (e.g., payment method number)

2. **Request Relevant Documents**
   - For deposit verification:
     - Submit a screenshot or video recording of the transaction receipt from the supported payment/e-wallet platform showing transaction details (amount, date, time)
     - Ensure the receipt includes the sender and recipient information, the transaction number, and the date/time
     - Use only official receipts (e.g., inbox receipts or designated transaction slips)
   
   - For withdrawal verification:
     - Provide a screenshot or photo of the last deposit proof (receipt or slip)
     - Submit a clear selfie holding a valid government ID
     - Provide a clear photo or copy of the ID
     - Ensure the ID and selfie are clear and ID details are readable

3. **Verify Document Authenticity and Completeness**
   - Confirm that the receipt and ID meet the following:
     - Receipt shows relevant transaction details matching the account or transaction record
     - ID is valid, unaltered, and clearly readable
     - Selfie and ID are clear, with the ID held close and visible
     - For deposit verification, the reference number, date, and time on the receipt match the deposit record
   
   - Note: For deposits via supported payment methods, only specific receipt types may be accepted; verify accordingly.

4. **Perform System Checks**
   - Cross-reference the submitted documents and details with internal transaction records
     - Confirm the transaction receipt matches a record in the system
     - Check the account details and contact information provided
     - Verify the current account balance aligns with the expected amount post-deposit or withdrawal
   
   - For deposit verification:
     - Ensure the deposit transaction occurred within the supported timeframe
     - Confirm the payment reference or transaction number matches the transaction record

5. **Complete Verification Review**
   - Assess all submitted information:
     - If all details and documents are verified as legitimate and match records, approve the deposit or withdrawal
     - If discrepancies are found, notify the player with specific instructions or request further clarification

6. **Process and Confirm the Transaction**
   - Upon successful verification:
     - Credit the deposit to the player’s account if applicable
     - Approve the withdrawal request if the account meets all verification and compliance requirements
     - Notify the player of the successful verification and transaction processing

7. **Handle Special Cases or Exceptions**
   - If supporting documents are missing, unclear, or invalid:
     - Inform the player of the specific deficiencies
     - Request re-submission of valid documents
   - In case of discrepancies, suspected fraud, or policy violations:
     - Escalate for additional review or hold the transaction pending investigation
   - Follow site-specific rules for thresholds, document requirements, or additional identity checks (these may vary by site; ensure compliance with current configurations)

## Notes

- The exact verification requirements and thresholds (e.g., timeframes, deposit/withdrawal limits) depend on the current site's configuration and official policies; verify these details for each platform.
- Always ensure documents are clear, unedited, and captured in good lighting.
- Use only designated and official transaction receipts compatible with the supported payment channels.
- For identity ownership verification during account access or withdrawal, multiple sources of proof (ID, selfie, transaction proof) are typically required.

## Common questions

- What documents are accepted for deposit verification?
  - Only official receipts from supported payment platforms that show transaction details are accepted; specific receipt types are preferred as per site policy.
  
- How long does verification typically take?
  - The process generally takes between 24 to 72 hours, depending on the site’s current workload and configuration.

- What happens if documents do not match or are unclear?
  - Verification will be rejected, and the player will be asked to resubmit clear and valid documents. Further verification or investigation may be required if discrepancies are suspected.

- Are there any special procedures for high-value transactions?
  - Thresholds depend on site policies; higher-value transactions may require additional proof or manual review.

- What should be done if the player does not have receipts?
  - Without official transaction receipts, deposits or withdrawals cannot be verified. Players should obtain proper receipts from their payment providers and submit them accordingly.

- How can players update or unbind their payment or withdrawal details?
  - Provide required personal data, valid ID, and a selfie holding the ID, along with the reason for the change or unbinding request, according to current verification policies.
