# Identity Verification & Compliance - Account Verification and Password Management

## Steps

1. **Identify the reason for the verification request**  
   - Determine if the request is for account recovery, password reset, transaction password reset, or account verification due to security concerns.

2. **Collect necessary player information based on the request type**  
   - Common information to gather:  
     - Full name  
     - Username or Member ID  
     - Registered phone number or registered number  
     - Registered email address  
     - Recent deposit receipt (if applicable)  
     - Main transaction or wallet account (if applicable)  
     - Valid government-issued ID (clear photo or scanned copy)  
     - Selfie of the player holding the valid ID (must be clear and readable)  
   - Be aware that specific procedures may require additional details such as linked bank account or registration number.

3. **Verify the provided information**  
   - Check the details against existing records in the system:  
     - Confirm matching name, email, phone number, and IDs.  
     - Validate deposit receipts or proof of transaction if required, ensuring the receipt is clear and shows senders/recipients.  
     - For withdrawal or transaction password resets, verify the ID and selfie for identity confirmation.  
   - Note: Exact verification thresholds and document requirements depend on the site's current configuration and official policies.

4. **Review submitted documents for clarity and correctness**  
   - Ensure ID photos and selfies are clear, legible, and meet quality standards.  
   - Confirm that deposit receipts or proof of payment are within size limits and show all necessary details.

5. **Conduct internal system checks**  
   - Verify if the ID and information correspond with the account records.  
   - Confirm receipt of any submitted deposit proof or related transaction records.  
   - Cross-check security or account flags that might influence verification procedures.

6. **Decide on the appropriate resolution based on verification results**  
   - If verification is successful:  
     - For password resets: Issue a new password, or guide the player to reset the password via the supported system interface.  
     - For account recovery: Re-establish account access and update security measures if necessary.  
     - For transaction password resets: Reset the transaction password following the confirmation of identity.  
     - For security indications: Escalate or ask for additional verification if suspicious activity is detected.  
   - If verification fails or details are insufficient:  
     - Inform the player that verification could not be completed.  
     - Request additional or clearer documentation if applicable.  
     - Advise on next steps according to the policies of the current site.

7. **Communicate the outcome to the player**  
   - Clearly inform the player whether their request has been approved or denied.  
   - Provide instructions for next steps if action is required from their side (e.g., re-submit documents, contact support).  
   - Reassure regarding the confidentiality and security of their data.

8. **Record the verification process**  
   - Log all submitted details, documents, verification results, and actions taken for audit purposes and future reference.

## Notes
- Document requirements such as file size, upload method, and photo clarity are subject to the current site's configuration.  
- Exact procedures, thresholds, and additional requirements may vary between sites; always follow the current official policies and guidelines.

## Common questions
- Verification processes may differ slightly depending on the type of request and site-specific policies.  
- If a player does not have a deposit receipt or requested documentation, advise them to contact support for alternative verification methods.  
- All identification documents and selfies should be clear and readable; unclear submissions may delay the process or result in denial.
