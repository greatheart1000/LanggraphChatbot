# Bonuses, Cashback & VIP Benefits - VIP Rewards and Benefit Management

## Steps

1. **Verify player eligibility for VIP rewards and benefits**  
   - Confirm the player's account status and VIP level, checking if they have met minimum activity or wagering thresholds as per the current site's configuration.  
   - Collect relevant account details such as registered contact information, deposit history, and betting activity.

2. **Determine the player's current VIP level and recent activity**  
   - Check the VIP level status in the player's account, typically located under the Member or Rewards section.  
   - Review recent betting activity, deposits, or other qualifying actions to confirm eligibility for ongoing benefits.

3. **Assess the timing and schedule of rewards distribution**  
   - Identify the scheduled times for reward distributions, including weekly, monthly, or event-specific releases, based on the current platform's configuration.  
   - Confirm whether the player has met weekly or monthly activity criteria for bonus or salary payouts.

4. **Verify fulfillment of activity requirements for ongoing benefits**  
   - Confirm whether the player has completed minimum betting, deposit, or activity requirements within the specified period (e.g., week, month).  
   - Check if the player has submitted any necessary documentation or receipts for benefits that require verification, such as luxury trip events.  
   - Ensure that the player has adhered to rules regarding the use of a single account and avoiding abuse (e.g., sharing IP, bank account, or phone number), especially for bonuses with anti-abuse checks.

5. **Check the distribution status of scheduled rewards**  
   - Review whether the reward has already been credited to the player's Rewards Center or account.  
   - If the reward is missing but the player has met all criteria, prepare to process manual adjustments or escalate to support.

6. **Handle cases where rewards are not credited**  
   - If the reward has not been received and eligibility requirements are met, verify compliance with minimum activity, betting, or deposit requirements.  
   - Confirm that the player's account activity falls within the valid period for the specific reward or bonus.  
   - Check for any restrictions such as account sharing, multiple accounts, or failure to meet turnover conditions.

7. **Process manual crediting or escalate issues**  
   - For genuine cases where the reward is due but not credited due to system delay or error, initiate a manual adjustment process in the back-office system according to the current site's policies.  
   - Advise the player that the reward will be credited manually if exception handling is required, and escalate unresolved issues to support if necessary.

8. **Communicate resolution or next steps to the player**  
   - Inform the player whether the reward has been successfully credited or if further action is needed.  
   - Explain any conditions or additional requirements that may affect future benefits, such as maintaining activity levels or meeting specific thresholds.

## Notes

- Exact thresholds, schedules, and reward amounts depend on the current site's official policies and configurations.  
- VIP upgrade bonuses are typically credited within a specified waiting period after meeting the upgrade criteria; contact support if not received within that time.  
- Benefits such as birthday gifts or event-specific rewards are credited automatically but may require documentation or eligibility confirmation.  
- Anti-abuse checks, such as restrictions on sharing IP addresses, phone numbers, or bank details, are in place to prevent malicious activity; violations may result in confiscation of rewards.

## Common questions

- The intervals for reward distributions (weekly, monthly) and specific timing depend on the site’s configuration and may vary.  
- Reward eligibility often requires meeting minimum activity or betting thresholds within the designated period; these thresholds can differ by site.  
- When rewards are not credited as expected, verify that the player met all criteria, completed any required verification, and that no abuse flags are active.  
- For discrepancies or missing rewards, escalate to support with relevant account details and activity logs.
