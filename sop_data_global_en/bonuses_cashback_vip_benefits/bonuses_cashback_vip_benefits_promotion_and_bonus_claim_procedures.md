# Bonuses, Cashback & VIP Benefits - Promotion and Bonus Claim Procedures

## Steps

1. **Verify player eligibility for promotion or bonus**
   - Confirm the player has completed the necessary registration steps.
   - Ensure the player has fulfilled any initial deposit requirements if applicable.
   - Check if the player has completed any mandatory registration actions, such as app download or ID verification, if required for the specific promotion.
   
2. **Collect relevant information from the player**
   - Confirm the player's account details (e.g., registered email, phone number, ID verification status).
   - Obtain the player's specific promotion or bonus claim request.
   - Verify the player’s IP address, device, and account linkage to prevent multiple claims from the same source, especially for single-claim promotions.
   
3. **Advise the player to access the Rewards Center or Promotions section**
   - Instruct the player to visit the designated area within the site or app where bonuses and promotions are listed.
   - Tell the player to check for any available promotions or bonuses eligible for claiming.
   
4. **Check system or promo eligibility requirements**
   - Verify if the player meets the specific criteria for the targeted promotion or bonus:
     - Minimum deposit or activity thresholds (as configured for the current promotion).
     - Completion of specific game play or activity in designated games if required.
     - Registration timing or VIP status, if applicable.
     - Specific actions such as clicking "Claim" or selecting the bonus options before depositing.
   
5. **Confirm procedural actions for claiming**
   - For automatic bonuses or promotions, ensure the system has assigned the bonus based on the player's activity:
     - Bonuses may be credited automatically once conditions are fulfilled.
     - If manual claiming is required, ensure the player clicks “Claim” or follows designated steps within the Rewards Center or Promotions page.
   - Remind that bonuses are often credited within a specified time frame or at scheduled times (e.g., after initial deposit or weekly).
   
6. **Review special cases or warnings from the FAQ**
   - Check for any flagged issues such as multiple accounts from the same IP or device, which may disqualify the claim.
   - Confirm that the bonus or promotion has not already been claimed (if limited to one per person/IP/device).
   - Ensure that the player does not violate any restriction, such as using the same bank account or phone number to claim multiple bonuses.
   
7. **Inform the player of processing and resolution**
   - If eligible, confirm the bonus has been credited automatically or guide the player to manually claim it.
   - In case of ineligibility or issues, clearly advise the player:
     - Why they are not eligible (e.g., unmet requirements, previous claims, system restrictions).
     - To review the latest official rules or help center details for site-specific thresholds.
     - To contact support if they believe they meet the criteria but have not received the bonus.
   
8. **Advise on further actions to qualify for additional benefits**
   - For ongoing promotions, instruct the player on the next steps, such as meeting turnover requirements, playing specific games, or participating in scheduled activities.
   - Remind players about standard policies, such as meeting wagering requirements before withdrawal of bonus winnings.
   
9. **Confirm the player's understanding and document the interaction**
   - Ensure the player understands their bonus status and any conditions remaining.
   - Record the claim attempt, player's details, and any system or manual actions taken for internal tracking.
   
10. **Follow up if necessary**
    - If the bonus has not been credited within normal processing times, advise the player to check the Rewards Center again or contact support.
    - Escalate any issues that require manual review according to the site's policies and procedures.

## Notes

- Bonus and promotion eligibility thresholds, schedules, and thresholds such as deposit amounts, turnover, or activity requirements vary by site and should always be checked against the current official configurations.
- System-automated distribution means that manual intervention by support agents is limited; emphasis is on ensuring the player completed required actions.
- Certain promotions may be limited to one claim per account, IP address, or device, regardless of activity in other accounts.

## Common questions

- Why haven't I received my bonus even after meeting the requirements?
  - Confirm eligibility, check if the bonus was automatically credited, and review site-specific rules regarding timing or claim process.
- Can I claim the same bonus multiple times?
  - Typically, each promotion allows only a single claim per player or per designated source unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- What should I do if I think I qualify but haven't received the bonus?
  - Ensure all conditions were met, review relevant official rules, and escalate to support if needed.
