# Bonuses, Cashback & VIP Benefits - Cashback and Rebate Management

## Steps

1. **Identify the player's eligibility for cashback or rebate promotions.**  
   - Verify if the player has met necessary criteria such as deposit history or activity in the designated timeframe.  
   - Confirm any site-specific eligibility requirements, including deposit presence within a specific period.

2. **Gather relevant information from the player.**  
   - Determine the type of cashback or rebate the player is referring to or attempting to claim.  
   - Clarify if the player has manually claimed the rebate or cashback in the designated system area.  
   - Check for any ongoing promotions or specific periods (e.g., certain days or dates) the player mentions.

3. **Check the system status and timing.**  
   - Confirm if the cashback/rebate system is operational and whether it’s within the recalculation or dispatch window.  
   - Be aware that the platform may undergo scheduled recalculations or pause periods (e.g., daily recalculation from a specified time).  
   - Advise the player to retry claims if systems are temporarily paused (especially during known recalculation windows).

4. **Verify betting and activity details.**  
   - Confirm that the player's bets are eligible, meaning they are made on valid games and without using promotional amounts or bonuses if such restrictions apply.  
   - Ensure the bets meet the minimum or maximum thresholds defined by the current promotion or site configuration (if applicable).

5. **Perform backend checks and calculations.**  
   - Calculate the applicable cashback or rebate based on the total valid bets within the specified period.  
   - Confirm that the total bets adhere to the policies for maximum cashback or rebate percentage allowed.  
   - Ensure that the player has fulfilled any turnover or wagering requirements related to their bonuses or promotions, if applicable.

6. **Assist the player with manual claiming procedures.**  
   - Guide the player to the designated claim area or feature, such as a "Rebate Button" or "Cashback" option, if manual claim is required.  
   - Instruct the player to claim the bonus promptly, noting that some sites may allow real-time claims.

7. **Check automatic dispatch conditions.**  
   - Confirm if unclaimed cashback or rebates are scheduled for automatic dispatch at the designated time (e.g., before a certain hour the following day).  
   - Advise the player that if no manual claim has been made, the rewards may be credited automatically after the cut-off time.

8. **Address delays or failed claims.**  
   - Inform the player that the cashback/rebate system may undergo daily recalculations or temporary pauses, impacting claimability.  
   - Advise retrying the claim after the system's known recalculation or dispatch window.

9. **Provide the resolution or explanation based on findings.**  
   - If eligible and all conditions are met, confirm that the cashback or rebate will be or has been credited, either manually or automatically.  
   - If ineligible due to criteria not being met, explain which requirements were lacking according to the current site policy.  
   - For discrepancies or issues, recommend checking the current promotion rules or contacting support with transaction details.
