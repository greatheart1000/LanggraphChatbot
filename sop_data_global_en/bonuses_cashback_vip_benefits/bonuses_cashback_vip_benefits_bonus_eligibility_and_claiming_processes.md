# Bonuses, Cashback & VIP Benefits - Bonus Eligibility and Claiming Processes

## Steps

1. **Identify the player's eligibility for the promotion or bonus**
   - Request relevant information such as registration details, VIP status, recent deposits, and bet history.
   - Confirm if the player has completed any required verification processes (e.g., identity or phone verification).
   - Check if the player meets any specific VIP or account status requirements for the promotion.

2. **Verify the player's recent activity and qualifying actions**
   - Review deposit history to ensure the deposit amount meets the minimum/maximum requirements for the bonus.
   - Check if the player has selected the relevant promotion during deposit or before claiming.
   - Confirm if the required game activity (e.g., valid bets, spins, or game plays) has been completed according to the promotion terms.
   - For campaigns with specific betting or wager thresholds, verify if they have been met or if the player has placed qualifying bets within the allowed period.

3. **Check for system restrictions and possible conflicts**
   - Ensure the player's IP address and device are eligible; bonuses/promotions are often limited to one claim per IP address and device.
   - Detect if multiple accounts sharing the same IP address, device, or contact details are involved, possibly restricting bonus eligibility.
   - Verify that there is no ongoing security check or suspicion of fraud activity, which could block bonus processing.

4. **Determine the mode of bonus distribution**
   - Identify if the bonus is automatic upon meeting the eligibility criteria or requires manual claiming via the bonus or reward center.
   - If automatic, verify system logs or notifications to confirm the bonus has been granted.
   - If manual, instruct the player to claim the bonus via designated platform sections (e.g., Reward Center, Bonus Page, Ticket, or Promotions page).

5. **Assess additional requirements and conditions**
   - Confirm if the bonus has a wagering or turnover requirement that must be fulfilled before withdrawal.
   - Check for specific game restrictions for bonus use (e.g., only applicable to certain game categories).
   - Ensure the player has completed any necessary steps like verifying contact details or providing documentation if applicable.

6. **Communicate the bonus status and next steps**
   - Inform the player if the bonus has been successfully credited.
   - If the bonus is still pending (e.g., under review or processing), notify about potential delays.
   - Advise the player about conditions for withdrawal, such as fulfilling wagering requirements or other restrictions.
   - Clarify that bonuses or cashback are distributed automatically once all conditions are met and that they will appear in the player's account.

7. **In case of non-eligibility or issues**
   - Explain possible reasons, such as not meeting the deposit or betting thresholds, sharing an IP or device with other accounts claiming the bonus, or incomplete verification.
   - Advise the player to review official terms and conditions or contact customer support for further assistance.
   - If applicable, guide the player on how to complete missing requirements or to verify their identity.

## Notes
- All bonus and promotion distributions are governed by the current site’s specific configuration for amounts, thresholds, and conditions.
- Bonus claims are limited by system rules regarding IP addresses and devices; using different IPs and devices may be necessary to claim multiple bonuses if allowed.
- Wagering and withdrawal conditions depend on the promotion terms; always verify the latest official policies for each campaign.
- Bonuses may be automatically revoked if suspicious activity or policy violations are detected.

## Common questions
- Are bonuses limited to one claim per IP or device?  
  Yes, bonuses are generally restricted per IP address and device; multiple claims from the same IP/device are often prevented.
- How can I check if I received a bonus?  
  Bonuses are usually credited automatically or can be checked in the Reward Center or Bonus Page of the platform.
- What should I do if I didn't receive the bonus after meeting all conditions?  
  Verify your activity and system restrictions, ensure all required steps are completed, and contact customer support if necessary.
