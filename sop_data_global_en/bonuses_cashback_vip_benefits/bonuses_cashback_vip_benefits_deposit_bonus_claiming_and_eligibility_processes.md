# Bonuses, Cashback & VIP Benefits - Deposit Bonus Claiming and Eligibility Processes

## Steps

1. **Inform the player of the available bonus options and required conditions**.
   - Explain that bonuses are typically awarded based on eligibility criteria such as phone number verification, making a deposit, and selecting the promotion during deposit.
   - Clarify that certain bonuses may be limited to one per IP address or device, according to the platform’s current configuration.
   - Highlight that the specific thresholds, amounts, or percentages depend on the official policy or current promotion details of the site.

2. **Verify the player's account information**.
   - Confirm that the player's phone number or mobile verification status is completed if required.
   - Check that the account details are complete and accurate, including contact methods used in verification.

3. **Guide the player to initiate a deposit**.
   - Advise the player to use supported payment channels or designated methods as per the platform's policy.
   - Ensure that the player deposits an amount that meets the minimum requirement for the promotion, according to the current official rules.

4. **Instruct the player to select the deposit bonus promotion during the deposit process**.
   - Warn the player that the bonus is typically claimed automatically if the promotion is activated during deposit.
   - Remind the player to check for the presence of the promo option and to select it explicitly if required.

5. **Complete the deposit transaction**.
   - Confirm that the deposit is successfully processed.
   - Assist the player in ensuring that the bonus selection was properly made during the deposit, if applicable.

6. **Verify bonus crediting**.
   - Check internal systems or the player's account to confirm that the deposit bonus has been credited.
   - If bonus is not credited, review whether the player used an eligible payment method, verified their account beforehand, and selected the promotion during deposit.
   - Note that bonus limits are enforced per IP address or device; if the bonus is missing, verify if the player has previously claimed it from the same IP/device.

7. **Address issues where the bonus is not credited**.
   - Confirm that the player’s account verification, deposit process, and promo selection align with current promotion rules.
   - If the bonus remains uncredited despite meeting all conditions, or if the player belongs to a shared IP environment, advise contacting support for further assistance.
   - Remind the player that bonus eligibility is subject to limitations based on IP address or device, and that some bonuses may only be claimable once per such environments.

8. **Inform the player about wagering or turnover requirements**, if applicable.
   - Explain that withdrawal of bonus winnings typically requires meeting the defined deferral or wagering periods, as specified in the platform’s current official terms.
   - Clarify that the specific turnover multiples or wagering thresholds depend on the current configuration and promotional terms.

9. **Advise the player to track their bonus status**.
   - Guide them to view their bonuses and points in the designated reward or account center.
   - Remind the player to complete any necessary tasks or bets outlined in the bonus conditions before withdrawal.

10. **Instruct on the proper handling of repeated or multiple bonuses**.
    - Reiterate that bonuses are often limited to one claim per IP address or device.
    - Highlight that attempting to claim multiple bonuses from the same environment may result in restrictions or disqualification.
