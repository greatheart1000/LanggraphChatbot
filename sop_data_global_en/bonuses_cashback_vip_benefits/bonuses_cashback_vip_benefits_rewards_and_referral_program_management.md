# Bonuses, Cashback & VIP Benefits - Rewards and Referral Program Management

## Steps

1. **Gather player information related to reward eligibility**
   - Confirm the account holder is interested in rewards, bonuses, VIP benefits, or referral programs.
   - Collect relevant account details such as deposit history, betting activity, or referral data to determine eligibility according to site-specific thresholds.
   - Check whether the player has met minimum activity or deposit requirements for specific rewards or VIP benefits, as specified in the current site's rules.

2. **Verify VIP level and associated rewards**
   - Determine the player's VIP status based on their deposit history or total betting activity, as per the site's current policies.
   - Confirm if the player is eligible for any VIP rewards such as cashback, weekly salaries, or benefits.
   - Check if the system has automatically upgraded their VIP level based on their activity; manual registration or upgrades are generally not required.

3. **Review weekly reward eligibility**
   - Confirm deposit and betting activity within the relevant weekly period according to the platform's configured thresholds.
   - Verify if the player has placed valid bets or deposits as per the weekly reward criteria.
   - Determine if the player has completed necessary activity to qualify for rewards scheduled for specific days (e.g., rewards released on particular days of the week).

4. **Check participation in special rewards programs (e.g., spin rewards, Friday rewards, Angpao, etc.)**
   - For spin rewards: verify spins made on designated games, ensuring they meet the minimum bet amount per spin; confirm spins count exceeds the minimum threshold.
   - For event-specific rewards: verify the player has logged in during the specified timeframes and completed the required activities (such as deposits, bets, or spins).
   - For Angpao or daily rewards: confirm the player deposited and completed the required turnover within the prescribed day(s).

5. **Assess referral program qualification**
   - Confirm the presence of a valid referral link or invitation code used during registration.
   - Verify the referred player has made a minimum deposit and placed bets as per the site's criteria for a referral to be valid.
   - Check if referral rewards or commissions are due, and whether the referred player's deposit and bet activity meet the thresholds for payout.

6. **Check reward withdrawal or claim status**
   - For rewards that require manual claiming: instruct the player to visit the designated reward or bonus center; verify the presence of claim options and that the reward is available for claiming.
   - For system-credited rewards: ensure the rewards have been automatically credited to the player's account or reward center as per schedule.

7. **Confirm eligibility criteria and special conditions**
   - Ensure that any special conditions associated with VIP levels, bonuses, or referral rewards (such as activity thresholds, deposit amounts, or specific timeframes) are met.
   - Note that exact thresholds and timeframes are based on each site's current configuration and official rules; always refer to the latest policy documentation.

8. **Resolve based on findings and system data**
   - If all conditions are met, inform the player of successful reward eligibility or claim approval.
   - If conditions are not met, explain the reason clearly—e.g., activity not sufficient, rewards not yet available, or specific eligibility criteria not fulfilled.
   - If discrepancies are found, advise the player to meet the required thresholds or activity and reassess later.

9. **Record the interaction and any findings**
   - Document the player's activity status, eligibility verification steps, and outcome for future reference or audits.
   - Note any important conditions, warnings, or special cases encountered during the process.

## Notes
- Thresholds, reward amounts, and specific VIP benefits vary depending on the current configurations of the site; always follow the latest official rules or help center guidelines.
- Automatic system updates generally handle VIP upgrades and reward calculations, but manual checks are necessary when discrepancies arise.
- Referral and bonus rewards are typically system-credited after meeting predefined activity requirements; always verify if claims are pending or credited automatically.
- Rewards and benefits may have time-limited claims or specific claiming procedures; ensure players follow these guidelines.

## Common questions
- Exact reward thresholds, reward amounts, and VIP level details depend on each platform's configured policies and current promotions.
- Specific eligibility criteria for VIP, bonuses, and referral rewards are subject to the site's latest official rules; always verify with current documentation.
- Rewards scheduled on specific days or times are processed automatically or require player action as per the platform's operation schedule.
