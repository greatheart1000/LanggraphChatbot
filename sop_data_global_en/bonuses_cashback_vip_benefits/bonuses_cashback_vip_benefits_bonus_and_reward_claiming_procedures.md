# Bonuses, Cashback & VIP Benefits - Bonus and Reward Claiming Procedures

## Steps

1. **Verify player eligibility for the specific bonus or reward.**  
   - Confirm the player's registration status and registration date if applicable.  
   - Check if the player has completed any necessary registration steps, such as downloading the official app or verifying identity.  
   - Ensure the player has met any minimum deposit, bet, or activity requirements as specified for the promotion or bonus.  
   - If identity verification is required (e.g., for birthday or VIP bonuses), request the appropriate documentation (such as valid IDs, selfies, or VIP level proof).

2. **Collect necessary documentation or evidence from the player if required.**  
   - Request relevant screenshots (e.g., ID, profile, payment details) or selfies as needed for specific bonuses like birthday or VIP benefits.  
   - Verify the provided documentation for clarity and correctness before proceeding.

3. **Check the player's recent betting activity and deposit history.**  
   - Review whether the player has fulfilled activity requirements such as minimum bets or deposits needed to qualify for the bonus or reward.  
   - Confirm if the player has active deposit and betting streaks if applicable to the reward.

4. **Determine the availability and eligibility for the reward or bonus in the system.**  
   - Confirm whether the reward was automatically credited or needs to be claimed manually via the Rewards Center.  
   - Check if the reward is available to claim within the designated claim period.  
   - For rewards that require manual claiming, ensure the player has interacted with the claim method in the specified time window.

5. **Guide the player to the appropriate process for claiming the reward.**  
   - Instruct the player to visit the Rewards Center or designated claiming interface.  
   - For manual claims, advise the player to click the 'Claim' button or equivalent within the valid window.  
   - For automatic rewards, confirm that the reward has been credited to the player's account before proceeding.

6. **If manual claiming is necessary, assist the player in completing the claim.**  
   - Confirm that the player follows the correct steps to claim the bonus—such as clicking the claim button after fulfilling all activity requirements.  
   - Remind the player of any specific claim windows or expiry times for the bonus.

7. **Verify that the player has met any wagering or usage requirements before withdrawal.**  
   - Inform the player of the necessary wagering or turnover conditions (if applicable), according to the current promotion or system policy.  
   - Check the player's account activity and bonus status to ensure compliance.

8. **Communicate the outcome to the player and resolve any issues.**  
   - If the reward is successfully claimed and conditions are met, confirm and inform the player.  
   - If the player is ineligible or conditions are not satisfied, explain the reason clearly, referencing the relevant requirements or policy.  
   - If there are discrepancies or documentation issues, advise the player to resubmit or provide clarification.

9. **Support the player with any additional questions related to the reward or claim process.**  
   - Refer the player to official help resources or FAQs if necessary.  
   - Escalate to a specialist or back office if the issue cannot be resolved at the agent level.

## Notes

- Thresholds for deposits, bets, or activity levels may vary between sites; always follow the current site's configuration and official rules.  
- Rewards may be distributed automatically by the system or require manual claiming; clarify the process based on the specific promotion.  
- Verify identity and eligibility documentation according to site-specific policies, especially for VIP or birthday bonuses.  
- Be aware of claim periods and expiry times for manual rewards; failing to claim within the window may result in forfeiture.

## Common questions

- **What should I do if the reward isn't credited automatically?**  
  Guide the player to manually claim the reward via the Rewards Center or support system, if applicable.

- **Can rewards be claimed multiple times?**  
  Usually, certain bonuses are limited to one claim per period or per eligible condition; verify the specific rules.

- **What if the player’s documents are unclear or rejected?**  
  Request clearer copies or additional verification if needed, and inform the player of any documentation policies or restrictions.
