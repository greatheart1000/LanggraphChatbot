# Bonuses, Cashback & VIP Benefits - Wagering and Bonus Claim Procedures

## Steps

1. **Identify the player's current bonus, cashback, or VIP benefit status**
   - Ask the player if they have received any bonuses, cashback, or VIP benefits.
   - Confirm whether the player has claimed any specific promotion or reward.
   - Verify if the player is participating in any ongoing promotion or VIP program.

2. **Gather necessary account information and verify player eligibility**
   - Collect player's account identifier (username or registered email).
   - Check if the player's account details meet the eligibility criteria, such as:
     - completion of identity verification (KYC),
     - provided valid contact information (phone number, linked mobile),
     - if applicable, confirm the player’s registration time or recent activity,
     - confirm the method of deposit or activity used to qualify for bonuses.

3. **Verify the promotion or bonus claim status**
   - Access the back-office or system logs to see if the bonus or cashback has been credited.
   - Check whether the specific promotion's distribution schedule has been met.
   - Confirm if any manual or automated bonuses have been allocated to the account.

4. **Check the applicable wagering or turnover requirements**
   - Determine the current promotion's turnover or wagering conditions, which may vary.
   - Calculate whether the player has fulfilled the required playthrough based on the following:
     - total amount wagered on eligible games (such as slots or fish games).
     - specific multiplier or play requirement per the current promotion (if available; otherwise, refer to the current site’s configuration).
   - Ensure the wagering is done within the promotional or bonus validity period.

5. **Assess special conditions or restrictions**
   - Check for restrictions related to:
     - usage of certain game types (e.g., only slot games contribute to turnover).
     - time restrictions for claiming or completing bonus requirements.
     - account status issues, such as suspected bonus abuse or low-risk wagering activities.
     - any multiple account activity, especially from the same IP, phone, or device, that might lead to eligibility loss.
   - Note if additional steps are needed, such as verifying identity or providing selfie proof for birthday or VIP bonuses.

6. **Guide the player to meet or verify completion of requirements**
   - Instruct the player to continue playing eligible games to fulfill remaining wagering or turnover requirements, if applicable.
   - Remind the player that some bonuses require specific wagering in designated game types.
   - Advise them to keep track of their progress, especially if daily, weekly, or event-specific goals exist (e.g., daily check-in, spin requirements).

7. **Verify the fulfillment of all conditions before proceeding**
   - Confirm that the player:
     - has completed the required wagering/playthrough,
     - has provided necessary verification documents (if applicable),
     - has met any activity thresholds for ongoing bonuses or VIP benefits.

8. **Process the withdrawal or bonus claim accordingly**
   - If all conditions are fulfilled:
     - Approve the withdrawal request if no further action is needed.
     - Or instruct the player to proceed with the withdrawal process, adhering to the standard withdrawal rules.
   - If the requirements are not yet met:
     - Inform the player of remaining tasks, such as wagering more on eligible games.
     - Advise on the deadline or period for completing the requirements.

9. **Address special cases and warnings**
   - If the system detects bonus abuse, account restrictions, or policy violations:
     - Explain that the bonus or withdrawal may be voided or restricted.
   - If the site-specific configuration differs (such as different thresholds or game restrictions):
     - Follow the current site’s official rules and configurations.
     - Remind the player of the need to adhere to promotion terms and conditions.

10. **Final confirmation and documentation**
    - Confirm with the player once all conditions are met.
    - Document the resolution status and any steps taken.
    - Provide guidance on expected wait times for withdrawals or bonus processing if applicable.
