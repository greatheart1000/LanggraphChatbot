# Payment Methods & Funding Channels - Payment Method Verification and Troubleshooting

## Steps

1. **Identify the payment method used by the player for deposit or withdrawal.**  
   - Collect details of the payment platform or wallet used, including transaction identifiers if available.  
   - Confirm the method (e.g., e-wallet, bank transfer, QR code, etc.) and ensure it is supported by the platform.

2. **Request the player to provide a detailed transaction receipt or proof of payment.**  
   - Accept screenshots or generated invoices, such as QRPH invoices or transaction summaries showing sender, recipient, and transaction ID.  
   - Verify that the receipt clearly indicates the relevant details (e.g., sender and recipient info).

3. **Check the status of the transaction in the external payment platform or wallet.**  
   - Confirm whether the transaction has been successfully completed and accepted on the payment platform.  
   - For QR code payments, verify if the invoice was generated and processed successfully.

4. **Verify the transaction details against the platform's records.**  
   - Match the transaction ID, sender, recipient, and amount with the internal system data.  
   - Ensure that the details align correctly and that the transaction was not canceled or failed.

5. **Assess potential issues if the transaction is not reflected or pending.**  
   - If the deposit or withdrawal is delayed, advise the player to wait for the processing time as per the site's policies.  
   - Remind that some methods may have longer processing times or automatic processing once network stability returns.

6. **In case of errors or failure, determine if alternative payment methods are available.**  
   - If the current method is unavailable or problematic (e.g., system issues, maintenance), inform the player about supported alternative channels.  
   - Qualified alternatives include other e-wallets, online banking, or deposit methods that are supported by the site.

7. **Confirm compliance with minimum/maximum deposit or withdrawal limits.**  
   - Check whether the transaction amount meets the configured thresholds for deposits or withdrawals.  
   - If below or above limits, advise the player accordingly and suggest alternative actions if applicable.

8. **Advise the player on troubleshooting steps if the transaction failed or is unresolved.**  
   - Ensure the payment was completed successfully in the external platform.  
   - If not, instruct the player to retry the transaction or use an alternative method.  
   - If the payment was completed but not reflected, ask the player to allow adequate processing time before contacting support again.

9. **Provide instructions specific to certain payment types if applicable.**  
   - For QR code payments, guide the player to generate the invoice via their payment app and submit the receipt.  
   - For wallet transfers, remind to copy and submit the transaction ID or TRXID as part of the verification.

10. **Record all collected information and actions taken for internal tracking.**  
    - Document the transaction details, correspondence, and resolution steps in the support system.

## Notes

- Payment thresholds and specific rules may vary by site according to the platform's current configuration; always refer to the latest official rules or help sections for precise policies.  
- For particular payment methods (e.g., GCash, PayMaya, etc.), ensure the player adheres to the supported minimum deposit amounts and generates necessary invoices or receipts for verification.  
- In case of ongoing technical issues with a payment provider, notify the player that services will resume once the problem is resolved and advise to try alternative methods in the meantime.
