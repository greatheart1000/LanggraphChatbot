# Payment Methods & Funding Channels - Payment Method Management and Troubleshooting

## Steps

1. **Gather initial information from the player**
   - Confirm which payment method(s) the player is attempting to use for deposit or withdrawal.
   - Verify the specific account details (such as account number, linked phone number, or payment ID).
   - Determine whether the player is experiencing issues such as deposits not showing, failed transactions, or account unavailability.
   - Collect relevant identifiers: username, full name, registered phone number, email address, and last successful transaction date, if applicable.

2. **Check the status of the involved payment channels**
   - Determine if the payment method is currently supported and operational according to the platform’s current configuration.
   - Verify if the specific payment channel (e.g., e-wallet or bank transfer) is under scheduled maintenance or experiencing technical issues.
   - If the payment method is temporarily unavailable or under maintenance, advise using alternative supported methods (such as other e-wallets or bank transfers) until the issue is resolved.

3. **Verify the correctness of linked payment accounts**
   - Confirm whether the player’s registered payment method details (such as account number or linked phone number) are accurate.
   - Check if the player’s payment accounts are within the allowable linking limits (e.g., maximum number of linked accounts for withdrawals).
   - Advise the player to double-check the entered account details before binding or unbinding.

4. **Perform internal system checks for linked accounts**
   - Confirm whether the payment method is properly linked to the player’s account in the platform’s backend.
   - Verify the status of the linked payment account (active, unlinked, pending verification).
   - Cross-check whether the account is intended for deposit, withdrawal, or both, and ensure compliance with platform policies (e.g., only one eligible account per transaction type).

5. **Assist with binding or unbinding payment methods**
   - If binding a new payment method:
     - Instruct the player to navigate to the designated section for payment account management.
     - Guide them to click on the option to add a new account.
     - Enter the account name, account number, and select the account type (e-wallet or bank).
     - Submit the information and confirm successful linkage.
   - If unbinding or changing a linked account:
     - Collect unbinding details, including the account number to remove, full name, and reason for unbinding.
     - Request supporting verification (such as ID and selfie, if applicable).
     - Submit the unbinding request for processing.
     - Note that unbinding may require a verification period (e.g., up to several hours) before the change is effective.

6. **Assess the transaction or linkage issue**
   - If a deposit is not reflected:
     - Check if the payment was successful from the payment provider’s side.
     - Confirm whether the transaction ID or proof of payment has been provided.
     - Verify if the player used a supported payment method and followed the correct procedure.
     - Remind the player that deposits made from unlinked or incorrect accounts may be rejected or delayed.
   - If a withdrawal or payout is failing:
     - Confirm whether the linked withdrawal account is active and verified.
     - Check if the account type and number match the platform’s configured limits.
     - Advise on unbinding and re-binding a correct withdrawal account if necessary.

7. **Recommend alternative solutions when issues are detected**
   - If the current payment method is down or not working properly:
     - Suggest using alternative supported channels for deposits or withdrawals, such as other e-wallets or bank transfer options.
     - For temporary issues, advise waiting until the problematic channel is operational again.
   - If technical issues persist or cannot be resolved immediately:
     - Collect all relevant verification documents (ID, transaction proof).
     - Escalate the case to technical support or back office according to internal procedures.

8. **Communicate the resolution or next steps to the player**
   - Inform the player of any verified issues, ongoing maintenance, or delays.
   - If a correction or re-binding is required, advise on the timing (e.g., confirmation period) before the account can be used for transactions.
   - Clarify that policies regarding unbinding, maximum linked accounts, or account verification may differ between sites; follow the current site's official rules.
   - Encourage the player to contact support with detailed information if issues persist after trying suggested resolutions.

## Notes
- Payment thresholds and limits depend on each site’s current configuration; always follow the latest official policies.
- Certain actions, such as unbinding or re-binding payment accounts, may require additional verification steps, especially for security reasons.
- System maintenance or technical issues affecting specific payment channels can temporarily impact deposit and withdrawal functionalities; stay updated via official notifications.
