# Payment Methods & Funding Channels - Alternative Payment Methods During Service Disruptions

## Steps

1. **Identify the affected payment method**  
   - Confirm with the player which payment method is currently unavailable or experiencing issues (e.g., due to maintenance or network problems).  
   - Clarify the specific issues reported (e.g., deposits/withdrawals unavailable, delays).

2. **Inform the player about the situation**  
   - Explain that the chosen method is temporarily unavailable due to service disruptions.  
   - Assure that funds are secure and normal processing will resume once the issue is resolved.

3. **Advise on alternative payment methods**  
   - Recommend other supported deposit or withdrawal channels available on the platform, such as other e-wallets, online banking, or cryptocurrency options.  
   - Note: The actual alternative options may vary based on the platform's configurations—refer to the current site's supported methods.

4. **Request supporting documentation for deposits in case of manual verification**  
   - Ask the player to submit a clear receipt or screenshot showing the sender and recipient details, transaction confirmation message, or relevant transaction information.  
   - Ensure the submission includes verification data such as transaction reference, amount, and date.

5. **Verify the submitted documentation**  
   - Check the provided receipt or screenshot against the transaction details.  
   - Confirm that the sender and recipient information matches, and that the transaction is complete.  
   - Be aware that deposit verification may require a processing period (e.g., within the timeframe set by the platform’s policy).

6. **Process the transaction upon successful verification**  
   - Once verified, credit the funds to the player’s account according to the current verification procedures.  
   - Notify the player that the deposit has been credited and that normal processing has resumed.

7. **Guide the player if issues persist**  
   - If verification fails or there are delays, advise the player to try alternative methods or contact support for further assistance.  
   - Remind the player to check for updates regarding the service status of the original payment method.

8. **Monitor the situation and update the player**  
   - Keep the player informed about the resolution status of the affected payment channel.  
   - Encourage trying again with the original method once it becomes available.

- During technical disruptions, funds in transit may experience delays but remain secure.  
- The process for deposits and verifications may vary based on the specific policies for each site, including the type of payment method and transaction thresholds.
