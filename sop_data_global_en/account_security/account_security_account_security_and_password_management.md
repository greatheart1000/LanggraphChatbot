# Account & Security - Account Security and Password Management

## Steps

1. **Identify the type of password or security credential the user needs assistance with.**  
   - Determine if the issue relates to login password, transaction password, withdrawal password, or account recovery.  
   - Confirm the specific action requested (reset, change, verify).

2. **Gather necessary information from the user for verification or processing.**  
   - For password resets or account recovery, request:  
     - Username / Player ID  
     - Registered contact information (phone number, email)  
     - Relevant identification (valid ID, selfie with ID, deposit receipts, or relevant account details)  
     - Screenshot evidence of account bindings (if applicable, e.g., binding account numbers)  
     - Last known balance or recent transaction information (if applicable)  
   - For credential verification issues, ensure all provided information is clear, complete, and current.

3. **Perform system or backend checks to verify user identity and account status.**  
   - Cross-verify provided details against stored profile data, including ID documents and selfies.  
   - Confirm that the ID and selfie are clear and the ID is held close to the face (if instructed).  
   - Check account activity, binding status, and profile completeness as per system records.

4. **Determine the appropriate resolution based on verification results.**  
   - If verification is successful:  
     - Proceed to reset or assist with password/credential recovery as per the applicable process.  
     - For self-service options (e.g., OTP, email verification), guide the user through the steps.  
   - If verification fails or details are incomplete/unclear:  
     - Inform the user of the requirements for successful verification.  
     - Advise on providing clearer documentation or reattempting verification.

5. **Guide the user through the password-reset or credential-recovery process supported by the site.**  
   - For login password:  
     - Direct the user to use the "Forgot Password" option, enter registered contact info, and follow the prompts to receive a reset code or link.  
   - For transaction or withdrawal passwords:  
     - Similarly, utilize dedicated reset options, often requiring additional profile verification (e.g., ID, selfie).  
     - Note that some passwords cannot be reset independently; support assistance may be required.  
   - For transaction password:  
     - Confirm that it is numeric-only (digits) as per policy.  
     - If reset is needed, instruct the user to follow the reset process via support or system options, ensuring their profile details are up to date.

6. **Assist with OTP or verification code delivery and confirmation.**  
   - Ensure the user receives the OTP or verification code via the registered contact method.  
   - Advise waiting for an appropriate time if the code is delayed or not received (e.g., 5–10 minutes).  
   - Confirm correct code entry before proceeding.

7. **Complete the password or credential reset process once verification is confirmed.**  
   - Guide the user to set a new password or transaction password, following the requirements (e.g., numeric-only if applicable).  
   - Instruct the user to confirm and save the new password securely.  
   - Inform the user of any additional security measures, such as changing passwords promptly after recovery.

8. **Advise on best practices and preventive measures moving forward.**  
   - Encourage keeping profile details up to date, including email and phone number.  
   - Recommend enabling available security features for enhanced account protection.  
   - Emphasize that transaction passwords (if applicable) should remain confidential and securely stored.

9. **Ensure documentation of the resolution in internal records and communicate the outcome to the user.**  
   - Confirm whether the reset or verification was successful.  
   - Provide ongoing guidance if additional support is needed.

## Notes

- Exact procedures and required documentation may vary depending on the site’s configuration and official policies.  
- For security reasons, sensitive verification steps (e.g., identity documents, selfies) must be clear and hold the ID close to the face as instructed.  
- Self-service password reset options cannot be used for certain credentials (e.g., transaction passwords); support intervention is required.  
- The format for transaction passwords is typically numeric only; self-reset may not be possible without support assistance.

## Common questions

- Verified user identity relies on matching account details, ID documents, and selfies provided.  
- OTP or verification codes may be delayed; users should wait and ensure proper network connectivity.  
- Passwords or credentials cannot be reset solely by the user when site policies restrict self-service resets; support must be contacted for assistance.  
- For detailed reset procedures, users should follow official guidance or support instructions specific to their site, noting that some steps may differ slightly.
