# Account & Security - Payment Method Binding and Management

## Steps

1. **Gather player information for verification**:
   - Request the player's username or account ID.
   - Confirm the full name associated with the account.
   - Obtain any relevant identification documents (e.g., ID card, selfie holding ID) if initiating unbinding or changes.
   - Ask for the current payment or wallet account details to be unbound or linked.

2. **Identify the type of payment method involved**:
   - Determine whether the player is binding or unbinding a bank account or e-wallet.
   - Confirm the specific e-wallet platform if applicable (e.g., GCash, PayMaya).

3. **Verify the current binding status**:
   - Check if the account currently has a bound payment method.
   - Confirm the maximum allowed bound payment methods per account (e.g., up to two bank accounts or e-wallets for withdrawals).

4. **Instruct on binding a payment method**:
   - For binding a bank account:
     - Ask the player to access the relevant section in their profile or member area.
     - Guide them to select “Bind Bank Account.”
     - Collect details: Bank Type, account name, account number, and transaction password.
     - Submit the binding request.
   - For binding an e-wallet:
     - Guide the player to the security or profile section.
     - Instruct them to select “Bind E-wallet.”
     - Collect details: E-wallet platform, account name, 11-digit account number (or respective length), and transaction password.
     - Submit the binding request.
   - Emphasize that the account name must match withdrawal or intended use names, if applicable.

5. **Verify correctness and accuracy of details**:
   - Warn the player that mistakes during binding (e.g., wrong account number, mismatched names) are their responsibility.
   - Confirm that the player understands they should double-check the data before submission.

6. **Handle unbinding requests**:
   - For unbinding, request:
     - Full name, username, the specific account number to be unbound, and reason for unbinding.
     - Upload or submit clear images of valid ID and a selfie holding the ID for identity verification.
     - Submission for processing.
   - Inform the player that unbinding requests are subject to verification and may take some time to process.
   - Clarify that unbinding may be restricted if only one payment method is currently bound.

7. **Ensure compliance with binding limits**:
   - Confirm if the player has reached the maximum number of bound payment methods permitted (e.g., for withdrawal).
   - Advise unbinding an existing method before binding a new one if limits are reached.
   - For e-wallets:
     - Clarify that only one e-wallet can typically be bound to an account at a time.
     - Players with only one bound e-wallet cannot unbind until they bind a second one (if policy allows).
   - For bank accounts:
     - Usually, a maximum number of bank accounts (e.g., two) can be bound.
     - To add a new bank account, unbind an existing one first if the limit is reached.

8. **Perform internal checks**:
   - Verify that the details provided are consistent with the player's current records.
   - Confirm the validity of uploaded verification documents.
   - Check for any pending transactions or restrictions that might affect binding or unbinding.

9. **Provide feedback to the player**:
   - Confirm successful binding or unbinding.
   - If errors occur (e.g., incorrect details, failed verification):
     - Explain that mistakes in binding or unbinding are the player's responsibility.
     - Advise re-submission with correct data if applicable.

10. **Special considerations**:
    - For cases involving multiple accounts or unusual activity, inform the player that violations may result in suspension or restrictions.
    - Remind players that certain actions (binding/unbinding) may be restricted by system policies or thresholds specific to the site, which should be checked in official help or rules.

## Notes

- The process of unbinding or changing linked payment methods involves verification documents to ensure security.
- The maximum number of bound payment methods and rules for unbinding depend on site-specific configurations and policies.
- Always follow the latest official procedures and policies provided by the current platform.

## Common questions

- Players should be aware that binding errors are their responsibility; support cannot rectify incorrect details post-submission.
- Only one e-wallet can generally be bound at a time; unbinding is only possible if the method is not the only linked account.
- Unbinding or changing payment methods requires verification steps, including document uploads and identity confirmation.
- For assistance with OTP verification or account checks, players may need to use standard communication channels and follow specific verification procedures.
