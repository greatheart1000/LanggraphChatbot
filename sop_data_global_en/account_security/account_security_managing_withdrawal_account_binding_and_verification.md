# Account & Security - Managing Withdrawal Account Binding and Verification

## Steps

1. **Verify player identity and current account status**
   - Collect necessary identification details such as full name, username, and a valid ID document.
   - Confirm whether the account is in good standing and eligible for withdrawal activities.
   - Check if the player has completed onboarded verification steps such as phone number verification.

2. **Determine the reason for account modification request**
   - Clarify if the player wishes to bind, unbind, change, or verify a withdrawal channel.
   - Collect relevant details depending on the request (e.g., account numbers, reason for unbinding).

3. **Assess current withdrawal channel bindings**
   - Review existing linked withdrawal methods (bank accounts or e-wallets).
   - Confirm the maximum number of withdrawal accounts supported per player as per site policy.
   
4. **Collect details for binding or unbinding**
   - For binding:
     - Provide the withdrawal account number or linked wallet details.
     - Follow the platform’s instructions for submitting details.
   - For unbinding:
     - Gather the account number or wallet to be removed.
     - Obtain a clear photo of a valid ID and a selfie holding the ID.
     - Collect the reason for unbinding.

5. **Verify submitted documents and details**
   - Ensure all images (ID and selfie) are clear, readable, and correctly match the account holder.
   - Confirm the submitted information aligns with the current account records.

6. **Initiate the request in the system**
   - Submit the binding or unbinding request via the designated process:
     - For binding: input details into the system and confirm submission.
     - For unbinding: provide all necessary information through the support system or internal tools.
   - Attach all required supporting documentation as per procedure.

7. **Perform security checks and compliance review**
   - Internal system checks include:
     - Validity of ID documents.
     - Matching account holder information.
     - Verification that the account isn’t flagged for suspicious activity.
     - Confirmation that the requested operation complies with platform policies.
   - Special cases:
     - Requests to unbind the only available withdrawal method may be rejected.
     - Repeated unbinding or binding attempts may trigger additional security review.

8. **Provide feedback to the player**
   - Communicate whether the request is approved, pending review, or rejected.
   - If additional information or corrective action is required, instruct the player accordingly.

9. **Complete the binding/unbinding process**
   - Once approved:
     - Update withdrawal channels in the system.
     - Confirm to the player that the operation is successful.
   - If rejected:
     - Explain the reason based on the review findings.
     - Advise on corrective measures or additional verifications needed.

10. **Advise on post-operation actions**
    - For unbinding or changing withdrawal details:
      - Recommend re-verification if necessary.
      - Remind players to verify new accounts (phone verification, OTP) before next withdrawal.

## Notes

- All unbinding requests require a clear ID and a selfie holding the ID; ensure images are readable.
- Players may be limited in the number of withdrawal accounts (e.g., up to two wallets/accounts per method).
- The unbinding process typically involves providing the reason to facilitate internal audits.
- Changes to personal details such as the account holder’s name are generally not permitted; updates usually require support intervention or new account registration.
- Withdrawal channel adjustments may be subject to platform-specific policies; always check current configuration and official guidelines.

## Common questions

- **What information is necessary for unbinding a withdrawal method?**  
  A valid ID, a clear selfie holding the ID, the account details to be removed, and the reason for unbinding.

- **Can a player unbind their only withdrawal method?**  
  No, unless an alternative withdrawal method is added first; unbinding the last method is typically restricted.

- **What if the ID images are unclear?**  
  Request the player to provide clearer images to proceed with the verification.

- **How long does the unbinding process take?**  
  It varies depending on the review process but generally requires internal verification before approval.

- **Can the same wallet or account number be linked across multiple player accounts?**  
  Reuse across different accounts may be restricted to prevent security issues.

- **What should players do if they want to update their withdrawal details?**  
  They should provide the necessary supporting documents and follow the platform’s unbinding and rebinding procedures.
