# Account & Security - Account and Payment Method Management

## Steps

1. **Gather player identification and account details**
   - Collect the player's registered username or ID.
   - Verify the player's full name and contact information (such as mobile number).
   - If applicable, request a valid ID and a selfie with the ID for verification of unbinding or changing payment methods.
   - For unbinding or changing linked e-wallets or bank accounts, specify which payment method or phone number is to be removed or updated.

2. **Verify account ownership and current linked payment methods**
   - Confirm the current bound e-wallet or bank account details with the player.
   - Check in the internal system which payment methods are currently linked (e-wallets, bank accounts, mobile numbers).
   - For mobile numbers, verify if the number provided matches the one on record; note that current policies may not allow changing this directly.

3. **Check eligibility for requested operations**
   - Confirm if the player’s current wallet balance or points are within the limits for exchange or withdrawal according to the platform's configured thresholds.
   - Ensure the player has completed any necessary verification steps, such as mobile number verification, before proceeding with sensitive operations.
   - Verify that the number of linked payment methods conforms to platform rules (e.g., maximum allowable linked accounts).

4. **Assess restrictions and compliance conditions**
   - Determine whether the player’s account is under any suspension or security hold that may prevent unbinding or changing payment methods.
   - Check for any suspicious activity alerts that could impact the ability to modify account details.
   - For unbinding or changing payment methods, ensure all required documentation (ID photo, selfie, proof of ownership) has been provided.

5. **Process the requested account management action**
   - For unbinding or removing a payment method or phone number:
     - Submit a request through the system, including all necessary documentation.
     - Follow step-by-step system instructions to complete the removal process.
   - For binding or changing a payment method:
     - Use the designated menu options in the profile or account settings.
     - Enter relevant details (such as new payment account number).
     - Confirm the details are accurate before submitting.

6. **Perform system checks and final validation**
   - Confirm that the new or unbound payment method or contact details are correctly reflected in the account.
   - Ensure that all actions comply with the current platform’s policies, thresholds, and operational rules.
   - If a change involves creating a new account (e.g., for a different mobile number), confirm that all prerequisites are met and that the action aligns with platform policies.

7. **Communicate resolution and next steps to the player**
   - Inform the player of successful unbinding, binding, or changes made.
   - If the operation requires additional verification or review, advise the player on expected time frames.
   - In case of denial due to policy or security reasons, clearly explain the reasons and possible next steps.

## Notes

- Some features, such as changing registered mobile numbers, may not be available immediately and could require future updates or direct support intervention.
- Exact thresholds for balance or points exchange may vary by site; always refer to the current site's configuration.
- The maximum number of linked e-wallets is limited; requests to bind additional accounts must follow the platform’s rules for multiple links.
- Verification procedures are necessary for unbinding or binding certain payment methods; ensure all documentation is clear and valid.
- Platform-specific rules may govern whether certain operations can be performed online or require manual review.

## Common questions

- Requests for unbinding or changing payment methods require proper identification and often a valid ID and selfie with ID.
- Mobile numbers cannot be changed directly in some cases; players may need to add a new number or contact support.
- Balance and points exchange are subject to minimum balance thresholds; ensure the player's wallet or points meet the configured or policy-defined limits before processing.
- Each site may have specific rules on the number of linked accounts; adhere to the maximum allowed and request additional links accordingly.
- For security reasons, suspicious activity may lead to account suspension or restrictions on account modifications.
