# Account & Security - Account Verification and Transaction Authentication

## Steps

1. **Collect necessary player information for verification**
   - Obtain the player's account identifier (e.g., username, registered phone number).
   - Request identification documents such as valid IDs showing personal details and date of birth.
   - If applicable, request a selfie holding the valid IDs for identity confirmation.
   
2. **Verify identity documents**
   - Confirm that the submitted IDs are valid, clear, and match the player's account information.
   - Ensure the documents meet the requirements for verification as per the current site policy.
   
3. **Verify contact information**
   - Confirm that the player's registered phone number is active and capable of receiving SMS or WhatsApp messages.
   - Request player to verify the phone number via system prompt, which may involve sending an OTP.
   - Ensure the OTP is received and correctly entered; retry if necessary, following the site's verification procedures.
   
4. **Verify transaction records (deposits and withdrawals)**
   - For deposits:
     - Request the player to provide a receipt or screenshot from the relevant payment channel inbox, showing sender and recipient details.
   - For withdrawals:
     - Request a screenshot or record of the withdrawal transaction.
   - Review the provided documents to confirm consistency with internal records.
   - Guide the player to access transaction records via their account (e.g., Member > Deposit Record / Withdrawal Record) and take screenshots as needed.
   
5. **Check for any suspicious activity or policy violations**
   - Review the submitted documentation for signs of multiple accounts, use of the same bank card, phone number, or IP address that could invalidate the verification.
   - Cross-reference deposit, withdrawal, or referral activity for anomalies, such as multiple account registrations or reward qualification issues.
   
6. **Assess eligibility for bonuses or promotions (if applicable)**
   - Confirm that the player has met the specific criteria for bonuses (e.g., birthday, referral, SMS invitation) such as:
     - Providing valid IDs and selfies for birthday bonuses.
     - Receiving SMS invitations and completing KYC for SMS-related bonuses.
   - Verify that the player’s account and activity meet the current site-specific requirements.
   
7. **Resolve or escalate based on verification status**
   - If documentation is complete and matches records, proceed to credit bonuses or approve transactions as per the rules.
   - If verification fails or documentation is incomplete, communicate clearly the reasons and request further information if appropriate.
   - For discrepancies or suspected abuse, escalate for review or take corrective actions according to internal policies.
   
8. **Provide feedback or additional steps if verification delays occur**
   - Advise the player to wait if they haven't received system messages (OTP, verification codes) due to signal issues.
   - Recommend restarting devices, checking internet connections, or re-requesting messages as needed.
   - If issues persist beyond typical delays, instruct the player to contact support with supporting evidence (e.g., screenshots).
   
9. **Finalize verification and update system records**
   - Mark the verification process as complete within the internal system, confirming identity, contact, and transaction checks.
   - Ensure bonuses or transaction approvals are credited automatically or manually according to the site’s procedures.
   - Document all actions taken for audit and compliance purposes.
   
## Notes

- The exact thresholds and configurations for transaction amounts, bonuses, and VIP requirements depend on the specific policies of each site and should be verified against the current official rules.
- Use the designated payment channels and official communication methods supported by the platform when requesting documents or sending verification codes.
- Always ensure data protection and confidentiality during the verification process, in line with internal policies and legal standards.

## Common questions

- Verification codes via SMS or WhatsApp are generally sent within a few minutes; if not received, reattempt after ensuring the contact details are correct.
- For issues with receiving codes or verification messages, steps include restarting devices, checking signal, and waiting before re-requesting.
- Players may need to submit specific documents and selfies to qualify for certain bonuses, with details varying by promotion and VIP status.
- Suspicious or malicious activity detected during verification may lead to account restrictions, suspensions, or further investigation.
