# Account & Security - User Account Access and Verification Management

## Steps

1. **Collect initial player information**  
   - Request the user’s username, registered phone number, email, and any relevant account identifiers such as main wallet account details or registration ID.  
   - Confirm that the username is entered correctly, paying attention to case sensitivity.

2. **Verify the player’s identity and account status**  
   - Ask for the user’s full name, valid ID, and request a selfie holding the ID, ensuring the ID details are clearly visible.  
   - For account recovery or credential resets, verify the user’s information against the stored data, which may include registration details, recent transactions, or linked payment accounts.  
   - Ensure the submitted selfie and ID are clear and legible.

3. **Check system or back-office data**  
   - Confirm the account exists and matches the provided information.  
   - Verify whether the user’s credentials, phone number, and email are up-to-date and properly linked to the account.  
   - For linked wallets or payment methods, ensure they are not already associated with other accounts if applicable.

4. **Determine the required action based on user request or system status**  
   - If the user is requesting account access, credential reset, or updating contact details, proceed with the appropriate procedure.  
   - If the user reports a balance issue or frozen funds, verify the account status and review any freeze or transfer logs.  
   - For account unbinding or linking payment channels, confirm eligibility and ensure the new details are not already in use on other accounts.

5. **Perform necessary verification procedures**  
   - For phone number verification, instruct the user to request an OTP via SMS or configured communication channels, and confirm receipt. If not received, advise them to wait and try again after sufficient time, or contact support with relevant screenshots.  
   - For identity verification, implement approval workflows to validate submitted documents and selfies.
   - For unbinding or linking payment methods, follow the site-specific procedures, noting that exact rules may vary by platform configuration.

6. **Implement the requested change or resolution**  
   - Reset passwords or login credentials upon successful verification, providing the user with instructions for login.  
   - Update linked payment details or phone numbers as supported, ensuring the new details are correctly linked and not associated with other accounts.  
   - For requests involving special bonuses or promotions, confirm user eligibility based on VIP status or other criteria, referencing current site rules.

7. **Notify the user of the outcome**  
   - Clearly communicate the completion of the process, including any important details or next steps.  
   - If additional verification or support escalation is required, inform the user accordingly.

8. **Follow up on unresolved issues**  
   - If verification fails or issues persist, advise the user to provide additional documentation or contact support directly.  
   - Document any anomalies or irregularities encountered during the process, such as reuse of payment accounts or account restrictions.

## Notes

- Be aware that specific thresholds, permissible linked accounts, or bonus eligibility may vary according to the current site's policies and configurations. Always follow the latest official guidelines.
- When handling sensitive data, ensure proper security and confidentiality protocols are observed.

## Common questions

- Verification steps may differ slightly depending on the platform’s existing security policies or configuration.  
- Certain operations, such as unbinding or linking payment methods, may require additional approval steps or support intervention.  
- In cases of suspected account sharing or misuse, additional checks or suspensions may be applied according to the site’s policies.
