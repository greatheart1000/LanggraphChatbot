# Account & Security - Account Balance and Verification Issues

## Steps

1. **Confirm the issue reported by the player**
   - Determine whether the problem is related to verification code receipt or account balance.
   
2. **Collect necessary information from the player**
   - Verify the player's registered contact details, including phone number(s) used for verification.
   - Obtain the user identifier (e.g., username or account ID).
   - If applicable, request a screenshot of the issue (e.g., message indicating OTP not received or balance discrepancy).

3. **Assess verification code (OTP) delivery issues**
   - Instruct the player to:
     - Confirm that the phone number is correct and properly formatted.
     - Ensure the device has good signal strength and is able to receive SMS.
     - Check that no security settings or app restrictions block message reception.
   - Advise the player to:
     - Request a new OTP and wait a sufficient period.
     - Restart the device and retry requesting the OTP.
     - Attempt to use an alternative phone number or SIM, especially if current provider is known to have delivery issues.
   - If the OTP is still not received:
     - Suggest updating the registered contact details to a different supported network or carrier, if possible.
     - Recommend trying again after some time to account for possible network congestion.
   
4. **Verify and troubleshoot account access and verification steps**
   - Attempt to re-verify the account using the updated contact details.
   - If verification continues to fail:
     - Check for any system or maintenance notices affecting verification services.
     - Confirm whether the account might be temporarily restricted or blocked due to security policies.
     - Contact support for further assistance with manual verification if allowed by the site’s process.
   
5. **Assess balance visibility and discrepancies**
   - Instruct the player to:
     - Log out and then log back in.
     - Refresh the page or app to update balance information.
   - If the balance remains missing or incorrect:
     - Confirm whether maintenance or updates are ongoing that could temporarily freeze or hide balances. (Balances may be automatically restored after maintenance.)
     - Check for any notifications regarding balance freezes or game/provider maintenance.
     - Advise to refresh or re-login after some time.
   
6. **Investigate potential balance or transaction discrepancies**
   - Request a screenshot of the current balance and recent transaction history if available.
   - Review system records related to the account for recent activity.
   - Determine if the balance issue is due to:
     - Maintenance or ongoing system updates.
     - Balance freezes in certain services or games during maintenance.
     - Potential account restrictions or security holds.

7. **Implement the appropriate resolution**
   - If verification issues are due to delivery problems:
     - Suggest switching to a different supported contact number or carrier.
     - Offer manual verification support if available.
   - If balance issues are due to maintenance:
     - Inform the player that balances are temporarily frozen and will be restored automatically after maintenance.
     - Advise to check official notices or support channels for updates.
   - If a discrepancy or missing funds are confirmed:
     - Collect all relevant documentation (screenshots, transaction IDs).
     - Escalate the case to back-office or appropriate support team for further investigation.
     
8. **Follow-up and confirmation**
   - Confirm with the player that the issue has been resolved or inform them of next steps.
   - Guide the player to avoid using unsupported contact details or carriers to prevent recurrence.
   - Emphasize that system updates or maintenance may temporarily affect balance visibility or verification success.

## Notes
- Exact verification thresholds and supported carriers may vary between sites; follow the current site's official rules and configurations.
- In cases of persistent issues, advise players to contact support with detailed information and screenshots.
- Always verify the latest official notices regarding system maintenance or known issues impacting verification and balances.

## Common questions
- Resolution often depends on the current configuration and specific site policies; when in doubt, escalate to technical support.
- During maintenance, balances may be temporarily frozen but are secure and will be restored automatically after completion.
