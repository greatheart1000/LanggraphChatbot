# Account & Security - Transaction and Deposit Record Management

## Steps

1. **Gather player identity information for verification purposes**  
   - Request details such as full name, registered contact information (phone number or wallet ID), current account balance, and any relevant recent transaction screenshots or receipts.  
   - For identity verification, especially for account recovery or password reset, require valid identification, a selfie holding the ID, and a short video stating the date while holding the ID.  

2. **Check deposited funds and transaction proof**  
   - Ask the player to provide proof of deposit, such as a screenshot of the deposit receipt or transaction confirmation showing sender and recipient details.  
   - For wallet-based payments, instruct the player to access their payment app’s inbox or transaction history to generate or share the invoice/receipt, ensuring it clearly shows the payment details and negative amount if applicable.  
   - Capture a screenshot of the deposit record from the system’s deposit history feature for reference.  

3. **Verify deposit submission**  
   - Confirm that the submitted proof clearly shows the relevant sender and recipient information, including the transaction amount.  
   - Check that the deposit has been processed and credited to the player’s account in the system.  
   - If the deposit has not credited, instruct the player to provide additional proof or attempt to locate the transaction through their payment app or bank statement.  

4. **Review the deposit or transaction history**  
   - Access the system’s deposit or withdrawal record section to verify the transaction details.  
   - Request or review a screenshot of the deposit or withdrawal record for confirmation.  
   - Ensure the records include the relevant transaction details, such as date, amount, and transaction ID, if available.  

5. **Address discrepancies or missing transactions**  
   - If a deposit is not reflected or not credited, advise the player to verify their payment or transaction history directly via their payment provider or bank.  
   - Provide instructions to generate relevant receipts or transaction records from the payment app or bank.  
   - Determine whether the issue is due to pending processing or system error, and advise accordingly.  

6. **Handle account recovery and security verification requests**  
   - For forgotten usernames, verify the player’s identity using registered contact details or registration number.  
   - For password resets, verify identity through provided ID, selfie, or video, and follow system procedures for account recovery.  
   - Advise on providing additional information if requested, such as registration details, recent transactions, or ID copies.  

7. **Ensure compliance with promotional and bonus eligibility requirements**  
   - Confirm that prerequisite actions such as mobile verification, identity verification, and binding of payment methods are completed according to the current site rules.  
   - For bonuses related to deposits or activity, ensure the player’s deposits meet the minimum requirements, noting that exact thresholds and rules depend on the current site configuration.  
   - Check for IP, device, or account linking restrictions that may affect bonus eligibility or claim validation.  

8. **Confirm any special verification or security procedures**  
   - If a site-specific policy requires additional proof (e.g., ID photos, selfies, or short videos), instruct the player accordingly and verify their submissions.  
   - Follow the system’s guidelines for handling suspicious activity, such as unusual betting patterns or transaction anomalies, including possible account suspension or review.  

9. **Finalize resolution and communicate next steps**  
   - Based on the verification outcomes, approve or deny the request or transaction.  
   - If approved, process the deposit, withdrawal, or account recovery as per the verified information.  
   - If further verification or documentation is needed, instruct the player on the next steps and waiting periods.  

## Notes

- The exact procedures for verifying deposit amounts, transaction records, or account identity depend on the current site’s configuration and official policies; follow the latest instructions available in the site’s help center or support guidelines.  
- For issues involving uncredited deposits or missing transaction records, ongoing checks with the payment provider or bank may be required.  
- All verification information collected must be handled securely and in accordance with applicable data protection policies.  

## Common questions

- The steps for viewing deposit and withdrawal records include accessing the Member section, selecting the relevant record type, and capturing a screenshot for support verification.  
- Deposit proofs must clearly show sender and recipient details; transaction confirmation from payment apps or banks should include transaction IDs or relevant reference numbers when available.  
- The eligibility for bonuses or promotions is subject to site-specific rules, which regulate verification steps such as device, IP, and payment method checks.  
- Identification and account recovery processes involve submitting clear ID photos, selfies with ID, and possibly short videos to verify ownership and identity.
