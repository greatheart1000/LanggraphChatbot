# Account & Security - Account Verification and Recovery Processes

## Steps

1. **Identify the reason for the verification or recovery request.**
   - Common reasons include login issues, OTP not received, account updates, deposit verification, or account recovery.

2. **Collect necessary information from the player to verify identity and process the request.**
   - Player’s username or account ID.
   - Registered phone number used for verification.
   - Player’s full name.
   - Valid official ID (e.g., government-issued ID).
   - Selfie with the valid ID.
   - Recent deposit receipt or transaction details (if applicable).
   - Screenshot of deposit receipts (if deposit verification is needed).
   - Any additional information relevant to the request (e.g., previous contact details, email address attached).

3. **Verify the provided information against internal system records.**
   - Confirm the accuracy and validity of the submitted details, including ID and selfie.
   - Check if the phone number on record is correct and verified.
   - For deposit verification, review the provided receipt or transaction details matching the account and transaction time.

4. **Troubleshoot OTP/verification code delivery issues if applicable.**
   - Confirm the mobile number is correct and has been verified.
   - Ensure the device has a strong signal and can receive SMS.
   - Advise the player to wait 5–10 minutes before requesting a new OTP, noting API or system delays may occur.
   - Limit the number of OTP requests per attempt or day as per system policy; advise waiting until the next eligible window if limits are reached.
   - Suggest trying alternative verification numbers or SIM cards if persistent issues occur.
   - If using third-party payment or wallet services, confirm correctness of associated contact details.

5. **Assist the player in completing any verification steps or form submissions.**
   - Guide the player to input verification codes, update profiles if supported, or follow link prompts.
   - In cases where personal details are immutable (e.g., full name), inform the player accordingly.

6. **For account modifications (e.g., phone number change, withdrawal account linking), ensure all required documents are provided and verified.**
   - Collect and review the necessary identification, selfies, and proof of deposit or transaction.
   - Confirm the documents are clear and all information is visible and legible.
   - Follow the account update procedures, which may involve security checks or additional validation steps.

7. **Decide on the appropriate resolution based on verification results.**
   - If identity and information are verified successfully, proceed with the requested action (e.g., account login, deposit confirmation, account update).
   - If verification fails or discrepancies are found, inform the player of the issue and possible next steps, which may include further documentation or assistance from support.
   - For persistent OTP issues, escalate to support or use alternative verification methods if available.

8. **Update internal records and systems accordingly.**
   - Confirm any changes or verifications are properly logged.
   - Note any special conditions or restrictions based on site policy (e.g., account name cannot be altered).

9. **Communicate clearly with the player regarding the outcome.**
   - Confirm successful verification, account update, or recovery.
   - Explain any limitations or additional steps if verification could not be completed.
   - Provide guidance for future verification or security processes as needed.

## Notes
- Exact thresholds for OTP retries or specific document requirements may vary depending on the current site configuration or official policies; follow the latest official rules.
- Personal information that is already linked to the account (such as full name) cannot be changed, unless specifically supported and verified through the proper procedures.
- When handling deposit verification, ensure the receipt details match the transaction time, amount, and payment method.

## Common questions
- How do I troubleshoot not receiving verification codes?  
  Ensure the phone number is correct, has good signal, and wait a few minutes before retrying. Limits on attempts may apply, and switching to a different number or provider can help.
- Can I change my registered personal details?  
  Full name and certain personal details may be unchangeable; verify policies before requesting changes.
- What should I do if verification documents are unclear?  
  Resubmit clearer copies that fully display the required information.
