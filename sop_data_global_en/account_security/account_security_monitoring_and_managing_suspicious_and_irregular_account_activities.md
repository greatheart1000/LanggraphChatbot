# Account & Security - Monitoring and Managing Suspicious and Irregular Account Activities

## Steps

1. **Identify reports or system alerts related to suspicious or irregular activities**
   - Monitor for alerts such as unusual login patterns, abnormal betting behaviors, or multiple accounts from the same IP address.
   - Receive reports from the player via support channels regarding irregularities observed in their account activity.

2. **Collect detailed information from the player regarding the issue**
   - Ask the player to describe the suspicious activity, including:
     - Nature of the activity or issue encountered
     - Specific dates and times of occurrences
     - Any error messages or alerts received
     - Details about recent account changes or access locations
   - Request relevant supporting documentation if applicable, such as:
     - Valid identification
     - Screenshots of relevant account activity
     - Deposit or withdrawal records

3. **Verify the player’s identity and account details**
   - Confirm the account holder’s full name, username, and registered contact information.
   - Check the account’s recent activity logs for abnormalities or discrepancies.
   - Ensure the player’s contact details (phone number, email) are consistent with known information.

4. **Perform internal system checks**
   - Review deposit, withdrawal, and transaction records for irregularities or discrepancies.
   - Verify if the player has engaged in activities inconsistent with typical behavior (e.g., irregular betting patterns, same IP with multiple accounts).
   - Check for any alerts related to abnormal login activity or multiple accounts from the same IP or device.
   - If applicable, check if the player’s account has been flagged for suspicious or prohibited activities such as prohibited betting, arbitrage, or account sharing.

5. **Assess the activity against established policies and thresholds**
   - Determine if the activity falls within the platform's defined thresholds for regular behavior.
   - Note that specific thresholds or rules may vary between sites; always refer to the current site's configuration or official policies.
   - Check for any violation of rules such as binding incorrect bank details, unbinding e-wallets, or multiple accounts from the same IP.

6. **Decide on the appropriate action based on the findings**
   - If the activity appears legitimate and within normal parameters:
     - Communicate with the player that no suspicious activity was detected.
     - Advise on best practices for account security.
   - If irregular activity is confirmed or strongly suspected:
     - Temporarily lock or suspend the account if required.
     - Require ownership verification, which may include:
       - Providing identification documents
       - Selfie with ID
       - Providing additional information requested
   - If suspicious activity involves financial transactions:
     - Review deposit/withdrawal records, especially for unverified or inconsistent details.
     - Suspend withdrawals pending review if necessary.
     - Verify the source of funds if applicable.

7. **Implement necessary security or account management measures**
   - Require the player to complete identity verification procedures if not already verified.
   - Pause or restrict account functionalities such as withdrawals until investigation concludes.
   - Inform the player about any restrictions and the reason for these actions, ensuring compliance with policy.

8. **Communicate the resolution or further steps to the player**
   - Provide an explanation based on the review:
     - Confirm if any irregular activity was detected and outline the actions taken.
     - If no issues are found, inform that the account is cleared and normal activities may resume.
     - If necessary, instruct the player on the steps to restore access or enhance account security.
   - Remind the player to adhere to platform rules to avoid future restrictions.

9. **Document the incident and actions taken**
   - Record all findings, communications, and actions in the internal system for audit purposes.
   - Keep copies of submitted identification or supporting documents as applicable.
   - Log any account restrictions or suspensions implemented.

10. **Follow-up and continuous monitoring**
    - Continue to monitor the account post-resolution for any further suspicious activity.
    - Adjust monitoring parameters based on the nature of the incident.
    - Reassess if additional verification or security measures are necessary based on the player’s activity or complaints.

## Notes

- The exact procedures for verification, suspension, or scrutiny may vary based on each site’s configuration and policies; always follow current official rules.
- For activities related to bonuses, deposits, or rewards, ensure compliance with promotional rules and eligibility criteria before making decisions impacting these aspects.
- Special attention should be given to transactions involving binding or unbinding bank details and e-wallets, as mistakes or prohibited activities in this area can lead to account restrictions.

## Common questions

- How to handle cases where a deduction occurred but no receipt is found?
  - Usually, this is a wallet-side issue; the deducted amount is typically bounced back within a specified period.

- What should I do if unusual login activity is detected?
  - Require ownership verification, possibly pause withdrawals, and investigate login patterns and device details.

- What actions are taken if abnormal betting activity is identified?
  - Withdrawals may be blocked pending review, and players may be advised to switch game types while investigation proceeds.

- How to verify deposit and withdrawal records?
  - Guide players to access their deposit or withdrawal records via the account interface and request screenshots if needed.

- What if multiple accounts are detected from the same IP or device?
  - Review activity for irregularities; accounts involved in prohibited activities may be restricted or flagged.

- How to handle incorrect binding of bank details or e-wallets?
  - Advise that mistakes during linking are the player’s responsibility; further modifications require verification procedures, and the platform may restrict modifications per policy.

- When to escalate an incident for further investigation or disciplinary action?
  - If confirmed suspicious activity or violations are detected, escalate for internal review, security department intervention, or account suspension as per policy.
