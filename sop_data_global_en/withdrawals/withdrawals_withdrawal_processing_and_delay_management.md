# Withdrawals - Withdrawal Processing and Delay Management

## Steps

1. **Verify eligibility to request a withdrawal**
   - Ensure the player has completed any required wagering or turnover, such as a full turnover of their current balance across eligible games, as specified by the platform's policies.
   - Confirm that the player’s account details are verified, including phone number and linked wallet or payment channel supported by the platform.
   - Check that the withdrawal amount falls within the configured minimum and maximum limits for the site.

2. **Request a withdrawal**
   - Instruct the player to provide necessary information:
     - Screenshot of the recent withdrawal transaction, if applicable.
     - Player identification details such as username (or player ID).
     - Wallet or payment account details, ensuring they match the registered account name.
     - Other relevant account data like current balance, last game played, verified contact information, and a selfie holding a valid ID, if required.
   - Have the player submit a withdrawal request through the designated platform interface or support channel.

3. **Assess withdrawal request for any restrictions or blocks**
   - Review the account for any flagged activity, such as suspected abnormal betting or irregular gameplay, which may cause delays or block the withdrawal.
   - If abnormal activity is suspected, advise the player to switch to permitted games and fulfill any turnover requirements before reattempting.
 
4. **Process withdrawal request in the system queue**
   - Submit the request into the platform’s withdrawal processing queue.
   - Inform the player that withdrawals are processed sequentially; requests are handled on a first-come, first-served basis.
   - Clarify that there is no guaranteed fixed processing time, especially during high volume periods.
   
5. **Monitor processing status**
   - Check the request status regularly—whether it is queued, processing, or completed.
   - Remind the player that withdrawals marked as “Processing” are in the queue and may experience delays.
   - Advise the player not to spam support or request status repeatedly, as this does not expedite processing.

6. **Handle delays or issues**
   - If a withdrawal remains in the queue beyond typical processing times:
     - Inform the player that delays could be caused by high transaction volume or additional reviews for large or suspicious transactions.
     - Request any additional verification or information, such as screenshots or transaction references, if needed.
     - If the transaction is under review for suspected irregular activity, advise the player to meet any additional requirements specified.
   
7. **Complete the withdrawal**
   - Once processed, confirm that the funds have been credited to the player’s linked wallet or payment account.
   - Notify the player of successful withdrawal completion.
   - Advise the player to check their external wallet or payment source if delays beyond normal processing times occur.

8. **Follow up on incomplete or delayed withdrawals**
   - If the player has not received the funds after a lengthy delay:
     - Verify the transaction status from the system.
     - Request the player to provide relevant evidence (e.g., screenshot, reference number).
     - Escalate the case to the financial or technical team if necessary.
   
9. **Cancelation and modifications**
   - Withdrawal cancellations are generally not permitted once a request is in processing.
   - If a mistake was made, instruct the player on any possible steps to dispute or request a review, as per the platform’s policies.

## Notes
- Withdrawals are processed in sequence, and processing times vary based on system load and request complexity.
- Large or suspicious transactions may be routed for additional review, extending processing times.
- During periods of high demand, delays of up to the maximum configured processing window may occur.
- Always ensure compliance with minimum documentation and verification protocols to facilitate smooth withdrawal processing.

## Common questions
- How long do withdrawals typically take?  
  Withdrawals are processed sequentially, and processing times depend on system load; delays can occur during peak periods or for large transactions.
- Can I cancel a withdrawal?  
  Withdrawals cannot be canceled once they are in processing.
- What information do I need to provide for withdrawal?  
  Confirm details such as verified account data, screenshot of transaction, and any supplementary verification documents as instructed.
- Why do delays occur?  
  Delays are mainly due to high transaction volume, security reviews for large or suspicious transactions, or system processing order.
- What should I do if my withdrawal hasn't arrived?  
  Check the status in your account, provide supporting documentation if needed, and contact support with your transaction reference for further assistance.
