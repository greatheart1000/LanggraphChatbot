# Withdrawals - Withdrawal Account Management and Binding

## Steps

1. **Verify the withdrawal method supported and binding limits**  
   - Confirm that only electronic wallet options are supported for withdrawals; bank transfer withdrawals are not supported unless explicitly indicated.  
   - Check the maximum number of withdrawal accounts (e.g., e-wallets or bank accounts) allowed per user, as per platform policy.  

2. **Collect player information for withdrawal account management**  
   - Request the player to specify the withdrawal account details they wish to bind or unbind, including:  
     - Full name  
     - Username or account ID  
     - Account number (e-wallet or bank)  
     - Reason for unbinding or binding request  
     - Supporting identification (clear photo of a valid ID and a selfie holding the ID, or other verification methods as required)  

3. **To bind a new withdrawal account**:  
   - Instruct the player to access their profile or account management section.  
   - Guide them to initiate adding a new withdrawal account:  
     - Click on the designated "Withdraw" or "Manage Accounts" option  
     - Select the appropriate account type (e-wallet or bank account)  
     - Enter the account details accurately, verifying the account number before submission  
     - Create a transaction password if required  
     - Submit the request for review and binding approval  

4. **Ensure verification of account details before finalizing binding**  
   - Confirm that the account number is correct to prevent fund loss, as binding an incorrect account can lead to fund loss and liability disclaimer.  
   - For certain payment methods or platforms, additional verification such as uploading images or videos of ID and self-holding ID may be necessary.  

5. **Handling unbinding or removal requests**  
   - Follow the verification process:  
     - Collect the full name, username, account number to be deleted, reason for removal, and supporting ID and selfie images.  
     - Submit these for internal verification.  
   - **Note:** The system may require manual approval.  
   - Unbinding is typically limited to removing one account at a time.  
   - If multiple accounts need unbinding, wait the specified period (e.g., 24 hours) before attempting another unbind.  

6. **Managing withdrawal account changes or re-binding**  
   - If a withdrawal attempt fails due to incorrect or unlinked account information:  
     - Recommend linking a new valid account following the binding process.  
     - If the account is linked to another user or has issues, advise unbinding the existing account first, subject to verification.  

7. **For linked bank accounts**:  
   - To add a bank account, access the "My Cards" or account management section.  
   - Click "Add Account" and select "Bank Account".  
   - Enter the real, registered account details, including account name and number.  
   - Submit for verification.  
   - To update bank details, provide validated information; modifications to account name or deletion may require additional procedures.  

8. **Limits and restrictions**  
   - Adhere strictly to the maximum number of withdrawal accounts allowed per user, as per current policy (e.g., two GWallet accounts, two bank accounts).  
   - Only unbind or rebind accounts within these limits.  
   - Reuse of withdrawal accounts across multiple user accounts is prohibited and may lead to suspension or account termination.  

9. **Withdrawing funds after account binding**  
   - Initiate a withdrawal via the available payment options, selecting from the bound accounts.  
   - If the withdrawal fails due to account issues, resolve by correcting or updating the bound account.  
   - For inactive accounts (e.g., no deposits for a period), may require recharging or meeting account activity requirements as per site policy.  

10. **Finalizing the withdrawal process**  
    - Confirm all account details are accurate and match the player’s official records.  
    - Proceed with the withdrawal request and monitor for successful processing or failure notifications.  
    - In case of failure, review the error, re-verify account details, and re-initiate the withdrawal if necessary.  

## Notes

- Always verify that all account information provided is accurate before submission to avoid fund loss.  
- The period before unbinding or re-binding an account may vary according to specific site policies; refer to official guidelines.  
- Unbinding or changing linked accounts may involve additional ID verification steps to prevent fraud.

## Common questions

- Only a limited number of withdrawal accounts can be linked, and unbinding is typically restricted to one account at a time.  
- Binding and unbinding procedures require identification verification to ensure security.  
- If withdrawal attempts fail due to account issues, players should rebind or update their account details following the standard procedures.  
- Bank account updates and bindings need to be verified against real, registered account details; changes to account names or deletions require additional verification steps.
