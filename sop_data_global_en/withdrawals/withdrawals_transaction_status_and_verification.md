# Withdrawals - Transaction Status and Verification

## Steps

1. **Instruct the player to access their transaction records.**  
   - Guide the player to navigate to their account's designated section for transaction history or withdrawal records.  
   - Emphasize that records can typically be viewed in the 'Member' or similar area of the platform.  
   - Advise the player to take a screenshot of the relevant transaction record for further verification if needed.  

2. **Request the player to provide details of the transaction for verification.**  
   - Collect specific information such as the transaction reference number, date/time, and the method of payment or wallet used.  
   - Ask for a screenshot or copy of the transaction receipt, especially if the deposit or withdrawal is pending or not reflected in their account.  
   - For deposit verification, ensure the receipt shows sender and recipient details as well as the transaction reference.  

3. **Review the player's submitted transaction evidence.**  
   - Check the provided receipt or screenshot against internal records, referencing transaction IDs, timestamps, and account details.  
   - Confirm whether the transaction has been processed, is pending, or has been rejected.  

4. **Verify the transaction status within the internal system.**  
   - Access the back office or internal transaction management system to locate the transaction ID or reference.  
   - Determine if the transaction is completed, pending, or rejected, based on system updates according to the platform's current configuration.  

5. **Assess whether the transaction reflects correctly in the player's account.**  
   - For deposits, confirm whether the credited amount appears in the player's game or main account.  
   - For withdrawals, check if the transaction is marked as completed or pending in the withdrawal record.  

6. **Determine the necessary next steps based on transaction status.**  
   - If the transaction is completed and reflects correctly: Explain to the player that the process is finalized.  
   - If the transaction is pending, rejected, or not reflected:  
     - Advise the player to provide additional documentation if needed.  
     - Check the transaction's reason for rejection or delay (if available).  
     - Follow platform policies for resolution, which may include further verification, reprocessing, or escalation to support.  

7. **Handle special cases or discrepancies.**  
   - If the transaction does not align with internal records:  
     - Request additional proof or details from the player.  
     - Inform the player that the support team will review and contact them with updates.  
   - If funds are deducted but not credited or reflected, instruct the player to wait for automatic system updates or contact support for follow-up.  

8. **Guide the player on transaction security procedures.**  
   - Remind the player that withdrawal transactions may require a transaction password or verification step—create or reset this password if necessary, following the platform's process.  
   - Ensure the player uses secure channels to submit transaction details and receipts.  

## Notes

- The exact process for transaction verification and rejection reasons may vary depending on the site’s specific policies and configuration.  
- Transaction thresholds, quotas, or specific policies are subject to each platform’s current official rules, so follow those guidelines accordingly.
