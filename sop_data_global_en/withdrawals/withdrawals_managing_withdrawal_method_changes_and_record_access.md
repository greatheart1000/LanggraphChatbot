# Withdrawals - Managing Withdrawal Method Changes and Record Access

## Steps

1. **Verify player identity and account details**  
   - Collect full name, username, and any required identification documents (e.g., ID card, selfie with ID) as specified by the current site's unbinding or account change policies. Ensure documents are clear and readable.
   - Confirm the identity of the player to proceed with withdrawal method changes or record requests.

2. **Check withdrawal eligibility and status**  
   - Confirm that the user's account is active and eligible for withdrawal—e.g., meet minimum deposit and wagering requirements, and is not under any restrictions due to suspicious activity or abnormal betting.
   - Verify that the account has no unresolved issues, such as pending transactions, rejected deposits or withdrawals, or restrictions due to system alerts.

3. **Gather current withdrawal method information**  
   - Identify the linked withdrawal accounts (e-wallets, bank accounts, or other methods).
   - Request the player to specify which withdrawal method they wish to change, remove, or add.

4. **Assess whether a withdrawal method change or record access is required**  
   - If the player requests to bind a new withdrawal method, they must provide the new account details and relevant verification documents as per site procedures.
   - If unbinding or removing an existing withdrawal account is requested, collect the necessary identification and reasons for removal.
   - For record access, confirm the specific transaction date and details needed for verification.

5. **Perform internal checks on binding/unbinding requests**  
   - Verify the player’s submitted documents and information against existing records.
   - Confirm the correctness of the provided account details.
   - Check if the number of linked accounts exceeds limits (e.g., maximum number of linked wallets/accounts).

6. **Process binding, unbinding, or updates**  
   - For binding new accounts:  
     - Enter the new withdrawal account details into the system.  
     - Save the changes after successful verification.  
     - Notify the player of successful binding.  
   - For unbinding/removing accounts:  
     - Review submitted documents and reasons.  
     - Remove the specified withdrawal method from the account after verification.  
     - Confirm removal with the player.

7. **Handle special cases or errors**  
   - If there are issues with the verification documents or details, request clarification or resubmission.
   - If the player provided incorrect account details, inform them about the importance of accuracy and request correction before proceeding.
   - In case of technical issues affecting certain withdrawal methods (e.g., payment system downtime), advise the player to use alternative methods supported by the platform.

8. **Confirm the withdrawal record and transaction status**  
   - For record access, retrieve the withdrawal log from the system.
   - Instruct the player to take a screenshot of the record for their reference and possible further reporting.

9. **Advise regarding failed or incorrect withdrawals**  
   - Explain that once a withdrawal has been successfully processed, the platform cannot reverse or alter it.
   - If a withdrawal was sent to an incorrect account, clarify that the company is not responsible for the mistake; advise the player to contact their wallet provider or bank if applicable.
   - For withdrawals that fail or are pending, inform the player that the funds will be automatically returned or that they should follow specific instructions for further support as per site policy.

10. **Finalize and communicate the outcome**  
   - Notify the player of the completed action—whether their withdrawal method change was successful, their record was retrieved, or further steps are needed.
   - Remind players to verify all details before confirming withdrawal transactions in the future.

## Notes
- The process for unbinding or changing withdrawal accounts may require additional verification, including ID uploads and selfies with IDs.
- Withdrawal limits and restrictions may vary according to site policies and configurations; always follow the latest official rules applicable to the current platform.
- Certain withdrawal methods or banks may temporarily be unavailable; advise players to use alternative supported channels.
- Be aware that some platforms may have specific procedures for handling suspicious or abnormal transaction activity, which could restrict withdrawal options.

## Common questions
- Players are often instructed to provide clear documentation, such as valid ID and selfies, when unbinding or changing withdrawal methods.
- Always double-check withdrawal account details, especially wallet numbers, to avoid irreversible mistakes.
- The maximum number of linked withdrawal accounts and the waiting period for unbinding may depend on the current site configuration.
- In case of system errors or technical issues, advise using alternative withdrawal methods supported by the platform.
- Remind players that withdrawal records can be accessed via their account interface and should be documented with screenshots for reference.
