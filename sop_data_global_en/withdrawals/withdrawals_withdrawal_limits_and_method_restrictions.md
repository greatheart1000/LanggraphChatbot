# Withdrawals - Withdrawal Limits and Method Restrictions

## Steps

1. **Verify the player's account status and verification**
   - Confirm that the player's account is verified and compliant with all necessary identification and documentation requirements.
   - Ensure the account has completed any required verification procedures before processing withdrawals.

2. **Gather withdrawal request details from the player**
   - Collect the player's preferred withdrawal method and associated account or wallet details.
   - Confirm the accuracy of the provided account details, including the linked contact information.
   - If applicable, check if additional e-wallet numbers are bound to the account.
     - Note: Only one bound number may be allowed for non-deposit players; additional bind requests require a deposit.

3. **Check the player's withdrawal amount against configured limits**
   - Refer to the current site's configured minimum and maximum per-transaction withdrawal limits.
   - Confirm the requested amount falls within these limits.
   - Note: Exact thresholds may vary by site; follow the site's official policies.
   
4. **Determine the withdrawal method eligibility based on amount and method restrictions**
   - For e-wallet withdrawals, verify that the amount complies with the specific method's limits.
   - If the withdrawal amount is below the threshold for preferred methods, advise the player to use alternative methods supported by the platform.
   - Check for any ongoing issues or delays affecting specific withdrawal channels (e.g., technical problems or operator delays).
     - Note: If an issue arises with the preferred method, suggest alternative channels such as different wallets or bank transfer options.

5. **Assess account activity and limits**
   - Verify whether the player's account has reached any monthly or daily withdrawal caps.
   - If limits are reached, advise on creating additional accounts or using alternative methods, if permitted.
   - Confirm that the account has met any turnover or activity requirements associated with withdrawal eligibility (if applicable).
     - Note: Withdrawal conditions may include meeting certain activity or turnover thresholds specific to current policies.

6. **Review for suspicious or suspicious activity indicators**
   - Check for signs of illicit activities, fraudulent behavior, or abnormal transaction patterns.
   - If suspicious activity is detected, inform the player that profits from such activities may be deducted as per policy.

7. **Process the withdrawal request in the internal system**
   - Submit the withdrawal request for review.
   - Attach or verify that all required proof of transaction, deposit, or identity has been provided.
   - Allow the standard processing time as per the site's policy (typically a designated window).
   
8. **Handle failed or delayed withdrawals**
   - If the withdrawal fails due to account limits or technical issues, advise the player to retry after the designated reset or retry time.
   - If withdrawal issues persist, recommend using an alternative method supported by the platform.
   - For delays caused by technical factors, inform the player of the expected processing window before attempting alternative channels.

9. **Monitor for withdrawal flags or restrictions**
   - Detect if the withdrawal request is flagged as fraudulent or illicit.
   - Take appropriate actions according to policy, including rejection and informing the player.

10. **Finalize the transaction**
    - Confirm the successful processing of the withdrawal.
    - Notify the player of the transaction status and expected credit time.
    - If applicable, update any relevant transaction logs or records.

## Notes
- Withdrawal limits per transaction and per day may vary; always refer to the current site's configuration.
- For specific channels or methods, the minimum deposit requirement may apply before binding additional accounts.
- Players may need to apply for additional accounts if they have reached their monthly or channel-specific limits.
- Allow a reasonable processing window before considering escalations or alternative methods.
- Always ensure compliance with current policy regarding suspicious activity detection and enforcement.

## Common questions
- Exact withdrawal thresholds, limits, and conditions are site-dependent; validate against current official rules and policies.
- If a withdrawal exceeds limits or is flagged, the player may need to use alternative methods or verify additional account details.
- Technical issues or delays affecting specific channels may temporarily restrict withdrawal options; advise accordingly.
- Regularly review and update the SOP to reflect latest policies and operational thresholds.
